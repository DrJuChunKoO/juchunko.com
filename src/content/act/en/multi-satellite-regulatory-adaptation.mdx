## Timeline

### 2025

- **2025.11.25**
  **[General Inquiry] Call to Break Communication Isolation**
  Legislator Ge Rujun pointed out during the Transportation Committee's general inquiry that 90% of Taiwan's internet relies on submarine cables—an extremely high risk. He urged the Executive Yuan to review Article 36 of the Telecommunications Management Act or adopt a "project permit" approach similar to Japan to allow foreign satellite services.

- **2025.10**
  **[Inquiry] LEO Satellite Communication Resilience**
  Legislator Ge questioned the Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) and NCC, pointing out that Taiwan currently relies solely on the ST2 geostationary satellite (Singapore-dominated) for backup, and OneWeb's coverage capacity is insufficient, revealing a huge gap in national communication resilience.

- **2025.04**
  **[International Development] Japan KDDI Launches Starlink Direct Connection**
  Japan officially activated Starlink direct-to-phone service, solving communication dead zones in mountainous areas and remote islands, providing an excellent reference for Taiwan.

### 2027 (Projected)

- **2027**
  **[Future Outlook] Taiwan's First Domestically-Made LEO Satellite**
  NSTC plans to launch Taiwan's first domestically-made LEO communication satellite (B5G program), taking the first step in domestic space communications.

## Key Issues & Q&A

### Q1: Will allowing foreign satellites (like Starlink) create national security concerns?

**A: Communication blackout is the greatest national security crisis.**
Some worry that foreign satellite companies may be controlled by other governments. However, Legislator Ge argues that the real national security crisis is "Taiwan being completely cut off from the internet during war or disaster." By allowing "diverse" satellites (not just one provider but multiple coexisting ones) and requiring ground data to pass through Taiwan's gateways, we can ensure communication resilience while maintaining information security.

### Q2: Why can't we rely solely on our own satellites?

**A: Too slow to help and too costly.**
Taiwan's domestically-made satellite is only projected to launch its first unit in 2027. Building a "constellation" capable of covering all of Taiwan (typically requiring hundreds of satellites) could take over a decade. Facing imminent geopolitical risks, we cannot wait. Adopting a dual-track approach of "leasing international services + autonomous R&D" is the most pragmatic strategy.

### Q3: How does this affect ordinary citizens?

**A: Signal in mountains, at sea, and in remote areas; faster disaster response.**
Beyond national security, LEO satellites can solve Taiwan's long-standing poor signal problems in mountainous areas and offshore islands. If "direct phone-to-satellite" is allowed in the future, citizens hiking Taiwan's hundred peaks, fishing at sea, or even during earthquakes when base stations collapse, will still have phone signal for emergency calls. This is the most direct form of "digital equality" and life preservation.

> **Call to Action**: The sky is open; regulations should not be self-restricted. Support legislative amendments to allow diverse satellites and make Taiwan's communication network unbreakable and more resilient!
