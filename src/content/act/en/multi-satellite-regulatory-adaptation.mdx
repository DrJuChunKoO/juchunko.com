# Multi-Satellite Regulatory Adaptation

**🚀 Breaking Through Communication Isolation! Legislator Ju-Chun Ko Strongly Advocates: Immediately Adapt Satellite Regulations, Build 'Submarine Cable + Microwave + Satellite' Diverse Resilient Network!**

### Crisis at Hand: Taiwan's Last Mile in Communication Resilience

Strengthening national communication network resilience is a key mechanism to ensure that communication networks remain available, secure, and can quickly recover during natural disasters, cyberattacks, or emergencies. However, there are significant concerns with the current national communication network architecture.

Currently, **over 90% of Taiwan's international internet traffic relies on submarine cable transmission**. Once these submarine cables are damaged by earthquakes, accidental ship damage, or more seriously, deliberately sabotaged by military operations, Taiwan will face a national security crisis of **complete network disconnection, becoming an 'information island'**. The international community even worries that Taiwan is only fourteen submarine cables away from "network disconnection."

More worryingly, in the "National Communication Network Resilience Enhancement Program" announced by the Executive Yuan, **the satellite portion only includes one ST2 geostationary orbit satellite**. According to public information, this ST2 satellite **is owned by a company with 62% Singaporean shareholding**. Chunghwa Telecom only leases the satellite transponder capacity; we are merely lessees. Whether communications will be cut off in a real emergency cannot actually be guaranteed.

### Outdated Regulations Hinder National Security Upgrades

Countries around the world have long regarded low-earth orbit satellites as an important solution for emergency backup communication systems. For example, during wartime, when other communication infrastructure is destroyed, low-earth orbit satellites can still ensure important communications continue to operate normally.

- **Ukraine** has become the first country in Europe to provide customers with **Starlink direct-to-cell service**, providing life-saving connectivity even in areas where networks are frequently damaged.
- **Japan**, with its many mountains and islands, also has nearly 40% of areas lacking signal. It has successfully tested direct-to-cell Starlink satellite services, where in remote signal areas **"as long as you can see the sky, you can connect"**.

In contrast, Taiwan's various ministries under the Executive Yuan currently have inconsistent positions on building communication resilience:

**The outdated provisions of Article 36 of the current Telecommunications Management Act are tightly blocking the door to Taiwan's diverse communication development:**

1.  Those establishing public telecommunications networks using telecommunications resources must have a **chairperson with Republic of China nationality**.
2.  **Foreign direct shareholding cannot exceed 49%**.
3.  Direct and indirect shareholding combined cannot exceed **60%**.

These restrictions prevent foreign satellite companies from directly providing services to Taiwan. Legislator Ju-Chun Ko believes that in an era of explosive space technology development, the country should not use backward regulations to hinder the free development of the communications market while also depriving people of the right to choose the most affordable and convenient communication services.

### Legislator Ju-Chun Ko's Strong Advocacy and Specific Demands

**Strengthening communication resilience is strengthening national security!** We need to make the most rigorous preparations for emergency situations. In the transportation committee's general questioning, Legislator Ju-Chun Ko presented the following strong advocacy and specific demands to the Executive Yuan:

#### 1. Immediately Review the Telecommunications Management Act and Move Toward Full Liberalization!

The NCC and the Ministry of Digital Affairs should be tasked to **study and re-examine the relevant provisions of the Telecommunications Management Act**, especially Article 36, paragraphs 4 and 5, which restrict foreign investment and nationality, **allowing Taiwan's skies to open to satellite services worldwide**. The prerequisite for national communication resilience is to establish a hybrid network architecture of "submarine cable + microwave + satellite" to ensure that basic overall communication operations can be maintained when a single system is damaged.

#### 2. Evaluate Special Permits to Accelerate National Communication Resilience Establishment!

To avoid a lengthy legislative process that affects national security, the Executive Yuan should coordinate the Ministry of Digital Affairs and the NCC to **refer to models from Japan, Malaysia, and the Philippines**, and evaluate allowing foreign satellite companies to provide satellite communication services to Taiwan through **special project permits** when necessary. The more foreign companies are allowed to provide services in Taiwan, the higher Taiwan's communication heterogeneity and security will be.

### Conclusion

Now is the best time for regulatory adjustment. We must break the predicament of "only one satellite above Taiwan," shed the outdated regulations of 70 years of rigid thinking, and with a higher vision and perspective, accelerate the promotion of technology policies and legal frameworks to make our country "Advanced Taiwan 2.0."

Legislator Ju-Chun Ko will continue to monitor and ensure that the government keeps its promises and acts immediately!
