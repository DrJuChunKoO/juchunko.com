## Timeline

### 2025

- **2025.11.25**
  **[General Inquiry] Call to Allow FSD Public Road Testing**
  Legislator Bao Ge (Ge Rujun) pointed out during the Legislative Yuan's general policy inquiry that global autonomous driving technology has matured, and Taiwan should not adhere to outdated 2018 regulations. He urged the Executive Yuan to immediately establish an inter-ministerial platform to study allowing Full Self-Driving (FSD) public road testing, preventing Taiwanese citizens from becoming "third-class citizens in transportation technology."

- **2025.10**
  **[Facility Launch] Changhua ARTC Smart Vehicle Autonomous Driving Test Site**
  Built with a 1 billion NTD investment from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, featuring all-weather, full-speed testing capabilities and simulations of extreme weather conditions like dense fog and heavy rain, providing an international-grade verification environment for Taiwan's autonomous driving industry.

### 2024

- **2024.05.27**
  **[Committee Review] Transportation Technology Regulatory Stagnation**
  During the Transportation Committee's review of the "AI Basic Act," expressed serious concerns about the slow progress of amendments to the Unmanned Vehicle Technology Innovation Experimentation Act.

### 2019

- **2019.02.25**
  **[Facility Launch] Tainan Shalun Taiwan CAR Lab**
  Taiwan's first closed autonomous vehicle testing site was launched, providing basic scenario testing including tunnels and pedestrian crossings.

### 2018

- **2018.12.19**
  **[Legislation] Unmanned Vehicle Technology Innovation Experimentation Act Promulgated**
  The starting point for Taiwan's autonomous vehicle development, establishing a sandbox experimentation mechanism, but also marking the beginning of subsequent regulatory stagnation.

## Key Issues & Q&A

### Q1: If autonomous vehicles are allowed, who is responsible when accidents occur?

**A: Following the UK model, responsibility lies with the "system" not the "individual."**
Currently, the public's biggest concern is liability attribution. Legislator Ge advocates following the UK's Automated Vehicles Act: when a vehicle is certified as operating in "autonomous driving" mode, legal responsibility for accidents should be borne by the vehicle manufacturer or software operator, not the passengers or "supervisors" in the vehicle. This not only protects user rights but also incentivizes manufacturers to improve safety.

### Q2: Taiwan's road environment is so complex (many motorcycles)—can autonomous vehicles really work here?

**A: Precisely because it's complex, AI assistance is more necessary.**
Human drivers get fatigued, distracted, and emotional—AI doesn't. Tesla FSD data shows that driving on urban roads (the most complex environment) is 5 times safer than human driving. Taiwan has advanced testing facilities like Changhua ARTC that can simulate extreme scenarios such as motorcycles weaving through traffic and backlight glare. We should first allow testing in sandboxes and specific road sections to let AI learn Taiwan's local road conditions, rather than outright prohibition.

### Q3: What benefits does allowing autonomous vehicles bring to Taiwan's industry?

**A: Taiwan is a hidden champion in automotive electronics—what's missing is a "training ground."**
Taiwan has a powerful semiconductor and automotive electronics supply chain (like TSMC, Foxconn, Pegatron, etc.), but due to the lack of local autonomous vehicle road regulations, our technology can only be deployed abroad. Allowing autonomous vehicles on roads would enable Taiwanese manufacturers to obtain valuable real-world testing data locally, accelerate technology iteration, and truly achieve "developed in Taiwan, deployed in Taiwan, marketed globally."
