# Autonomous Driving Deployment Initiative

**🚨 Taiwan's Transportation Technology Stagnation! Legislator Ju-Chun Ko Criticizes: Don't Let Taiwanese Become 'Third-Class Citizens in Transportation Technology'!**

### Frozen in Time: Taiwan's Longest Wait for Autonomous Driving Legislation

The application of unmanned vehicle technology is expanding infinitely in major cities around the world. It not only enhances people's work efficiency and quality of life, but can also effectively **reduce loss of life and property caused by traffic accidents** through its high level of safety. However, looking back at Taiwan, since **the passage of the Unmanned Vehicle Technology Innovation Experimentation Act in 2018, there has been no progress in amending regulations by relevant ministries, as if frozen in time**.

Currently, for unmanned vehicles or autonomous vehicle services (such as Robotaxi unmanned taxis), **there is still only the Unmanned Vehicle Technology Innovation Experimentation Act, with no relevant legal basis** to allow Taiwanese people to enjoy the latest transportation technology. This administrative negligence forces Taiwanese people to become **"third-class citizens in transportation technology"**.

### International Competition Intensifies: We Cannot Remain Complacent

Global top experts predict that **2026 will be a year of major breakthroughs in unmanned vehicles and autonomous driving technology**. Countries around the world have long regarded the legalization of autonomous driving as core to national competitiveness:

- **United Kingdom**: Completed legislation of the **Automated Vehicles Act in May 2024**, and plans to update related implementation details in 2025.
- **Germany**: Has established **Level 4 autonomous driving legislation since 2021**, allowing operation within specific operational domains, and will **permit remote driving on roads starting December 1, 2025**.
- **Japan**: The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism released OTA update guidelines on October 10, 2025, and is expected to **approve general road testing and official operation of FSD (Full Self-Driving) by the end of 2025**.
- **South Korea**: The latest news indicates that **FSD (Full Self-Driving) has been launched in South Korea**, making it the second market in Asia to get FSD.

Additionally, competition between Chinese and American tech giants in the Robotaxi field is heating up. For example, Baidu and Waymo **plan to conduct robotaxi experiments in London, UK in 2026**, becoming the first commercial pilot in Europe.

### Scientific Data Proves: Autonomous Systems Are Safer!

In response to safety concerns that the Ministry of Transportation might raise about opening up autonomous vehicles, Legislator Ju-Chun Ko strongly refutes administrative negligence with objective scientific data:

Tesla's FSD safety report shows a total of 6.3 billion miles driven, including 2.8 billion miles on urban roads. The data proves that when using FSD:

- **Major collisions (serious accidents)** are reduced by **7 times**.
- **Minor collisions (fender benders)** are reduced by **7 times**.
- **General road collisions** are reduced by **5 times**.

**Scientific data is fair and objective, and can always refute politicians who are unwilling to work.** The legislator advocates that autonomous vehicles developed by Taiwanese engineers should be allowed to officially operate on Taiwan's roads.

### Legislator Ju-Chun Ko's Strong Advocacy: Immediately Establish an Inter-Ministerial Platform and Start Legalization!

**Taiwan absolutely cannot remain complacent and stay on the sidelines**. Whether amending the Road Traffic Management and Penalty Act, the Highway Act, or drafting new Unmanned Vehicle Special Laws, we must open our doors and maintain a friendly attitude toward foreign technology.

Legislator Ju-Chun Ko has made the following specific demands to the Executive Yuan, requiring the government to act immediately:

#### 1. Immediately Establish an Inter-Ministerial Platform to Study Legislative Feasibility!

The Executive Yuan should be tasked to **immediately coordinate the Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Economic Affairs and other relevant ministries**, **establish an inter-ministerial platform immediately**, and **study the feasibility of amending laws regarding unmanned vehicles and autonomous driving technology**, allowing Taiwanese to rid themselves of the stigma of being third-class citizens in transportation technology.

#### 2. Take the First Step in Legalization by Allowing FSD to Conduct General Road Tests!

Following the practices of other countries, **FSD should be gradually allowed to conduct general road tests**, with a commitment to take at least the first step in the autonomous driving legalization process next year.

**Success or failure hinges on this decision!** We need the government to accelerate the promotion of a technology legal framework with a higher vision and perspective, ensure the safety of people's lives and property, and secure Taiwan's position in the global wave of transportation technology!
