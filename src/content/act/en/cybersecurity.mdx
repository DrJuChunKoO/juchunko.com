# Cybersecurity Legislation and Issues

**🚨 Defending Digital Territory! Legislator Ju-Chun Ko Strongly Demands: Immediately Supplement Cybersecurity Budget with Special Projects, End 'Erroneous Anti-Fraud' Violations of Human Rights!**

### Alarm for Technology Foundation: The Dual Challenge of Cybersecurity and Digital Human Rights

In an era of rapid technological development, for a nation to establish true digital resilience, it must be built on the unshakable foundation of **cybersecurity (information security)** and **digital human rights**. In the Legislative Yuan's general questioning session, Legislator Ju-Chun Ko issued stern warnings and specific demands to the Executive Yuan regarding Taiwan's cybersecurity protection "weakest link" problem, the chaos of government "erroneous anti-fraud" violations of human rights, and the national security threats posed by offshore generative AI.

## I. The "Weakest Link" Crisis in National Cybersecurity Defense: Only NT$59 Budget Per Enterprise

The cybersecurity industry often mentions the "bucket theory," meaning that how much water a bucket can hold is determined by its shortest stave. For Taiwan, the weakest link in cybersecurity protection resilience is precisely **our country's 1.68 million SMEs**.

The Legislative Yuan has passed the third reading of the amendment to the Cybersecurity Management Act, which added the legal basis that "**the government should assist the private sector in handling, responding to, and preventing major cybersecurity incidents**," clearly establishing the foundation for public-private cybersecurity cooperation. However, the government's resource investment is seriously disconnected from this policy goal:

- **Severely Insufficient Budget:** Currently, the government invests only about **NT$100 million annually** in public-private governance mechanisms. Calculated based on our country's **1.68 million SMEs**, each company can only receive about **NT$59** in cybersecurity defense budget per year.
- **Legislator's Anger:** The legislator criticized this amount as "**not enough to buy even one lunch box**," fundamentally unable to provide effective cybersecurity protection, causing SMEs to become "sitting ducks" in hackers' eyes.
- **Cybersecurity Blind Spot:** Furthermore, while the government claims to build society-wide cybersecurity defense resilience, it **has not grasped the total number of cybersecurity incidents occurring in private enterprises**, only having statistics from government departments and critical infrastructure, as well as the number of "computer interference" cases handled by the police department, essentially "**fighting blindfolded**."

**[Legislator's Demand]** Legislator Ju-Chun Ko demands that the Executive Yuan study and provide a **cross-year project plan** to promote cybersecurity defense for our SMEs, in order to quickly strengthen the weakest link in the cybersecurity protection system.

## II. Erroneous Anti-Fraud and the Fall of Digital Human Rights: Citizen Freedom Under "Digital Control"

To combat fraud, the government has **erroneously included some citizens' accounts on takedown lists**, resulting in their digital accounts being suspended. When citizens' digital human rights are infringed upon, the government's response is "**you can appeal through Meta's appeal channels**."

The legislator solemnly pointed out that citizens pay taxes to the government, not to Meta. Having accounts erroneously marked as fraud and suspended not only infringes upon the **freedom, survival rights, work rights, property rights**, and even **reputation rights** granted to citizens by the constitution, but amounts to **social death**. The Ministry of Digital Affairs and the Financial Supervisory Commission, among other relevant ministries, have received fewer than 100 appeal cases in nearly 14 months, showing that the government has not taken citizens' heartaches seriously.

**[Four Demands for Protecting Digital Human Rights]** The legislator demands that the Executive Yuan must commit on the spot to immediately take the following four measures to defend citizens' digital human rights:

1.  **Establish a single government complaint window**.
2.  **Regularly publish monthly** the number of suspended social media accounts, the number of accounts appealed, and the **number of accounts restored** after appeal.
3.  **Regularly review algorithms**, and the **error rate after each review must be lower than the previous one**.
4.  **Cannot use citizens' real social media accounts to train and verify AI**.

## III. National Security Alert: Potential Cybersecurity Risks of Offshore Generative AI

Cybersecurity threats come not only from traditional hackers but also from offshore generative AI models with geopolitical risks. Testing results from the National Security Bureau show that **5 Chinese-made generative AI language models** (including DeepSeek, Doubao, ERNIE Bot, Tongyi Qianwen, and Tencent Yuanbao) pose significant cybersecurity risks.

- **Excessive Information Collection and Privacy Terms:** All models commonly have problems such as **collecting geolocation information, system information**, and **taking screenshots**. At the same time, these models force users to agree to **unreasonable privacy terms**.
- **Content Censorship Mechanisms:** These models commonly have **keyword censorship mechanisms** that exclude keywords such as "democracy," "freedom," "human rights," and "June 4th Tiananmen Incident."
- **National Security and Cyberattack Risks:** When involving Taiwan's sovereignty and international issues, the generated content only adopts the **Chinese authorities' position**. More seriously, these AI models can easily generate **inflammatory content**, smear campaigns or spread rumors, and can even generate **cyberattack commands** or **vulnerability exploitation code** under specific circumstances, exacerbating cyber threats.

## IV. Legal System and International Integration: Accelerating Personal Data Protection Act Modernization

To ensure digital human rights, the government has promoted the draft Personal Data Protection Commission Organization Act and will promote amendments to the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in stages. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), due to its strict regulations, is viewed as the strictest privacy regulation in history, with **extraterritorial impact** on companies operating globally.

Although our PDPA and GDPR share common personal data protection principles, there are still shortcomings in protecting individual rights:

- **Rights Gaps:** Our PDPA **clearly lacks** regulations such as "**data portability rights**," "**automated digital profiling permission rights**," and "**right to deletion** (right to be forgotten) when collection or processing purposes are no longer needed."

Accelerating the revision of the PDPA and integrating with international legal systems is an important prerequisite for the government to develop **trustworthy AI** and a key to protecting citizens' information autonomy.

Legislator Ju-Chun Ko will continue to monitor and ensure that the government keeps its promises and acts immediately, so that our country truly achieves **cybersecurity is national security** in the digital age and comprehensively **defends digital human rights**!
