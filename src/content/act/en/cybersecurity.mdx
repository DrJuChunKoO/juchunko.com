## Timeline

### 2025

- **2025.11.25**
  **[General Inquiry] Cybersecurity Budget and Digital Human Rights**
  Legislator Ge Rujun pointed out during the Legislative Yuan's general policy inquiry that SME cybersecurity budgets are severely insufficient, and government anti-fraud measures may infringe on digital human rights. He demanded the Executive Yuan increase cybersecurity budgets and establish a single complaint window.

- **2025.11**
  **[Supply Chain Attack] Digital Marketing Company Hacked**
  Taiwanese digital marketing companies were compromised long-term by Chinese hacking group APT24, affecting over 1,000 customer domains, exposing the extreme vulnerability of supply chain cybersecurity defenses.

- **2025.06**
  **[Trust Crisis] Chrome Stops Trusting Chunghwa Telecom Certificates**
  Google announced that Chrome browser would no longer trust newly-issued commercial certificates from Chunghwa Telecom, severely damaging the national telecom operator's cybersecurity credibility and affecting government agencies and financial institutions.

- **2025.03**
  **[Healthcare Security] CrazyHunter Ransomware Rampage**
  Ransomware specifically targeting Taiwan attacked MacKay Memorial Hospital and other medical centers. The Ministry of Health and Welfare characterized it as a "systematic attack," posing major threats to patient privacy and medical operations.

### 2024

- **2024.03.19**
  **[General Inquiry] AI Fraud Deepfake Video Inquiry**
  Legislator Ge Rujun played two AI-generated videos in the Legislative Yuan and asked Premier Chen Chien-jen to identify which was real. The Premier could not distinguish them. This highlighted the AI fraud crisis of "seeing is no longer believing" and demanded concrete government countermeasures.

  **[Warning] Asia-Pacific Cyberattack Leader**
  Check Point Research reported that Taiwan is the most frequently attacked country in the Asia-Pacific region, suffering an average of nearly 4,000 attacks per week.

## Key Issues & Q&A

### Q1: Will cybersecurity law amendments become a tool for government surveillance of citizens?

**A: The focus of amendments is "protection" not "surveillance."**
Legislator Ge emphasizes that the core of cybersecurity reform is requiring enterprises and government agencies to fulfill cybersecurity protection obligations (such as data encryption and regular drills) and establishing independent oversight mechanisms. Regarding public concerns about "digital surveillance," the legislator has proposed four key demands for "digital human rights," clearly opposing government abuse of anti-fraud justifications to block citizen accounts or monitor communications without due process.

### Q2: Why emphasize SME cybersecurity budgets?

**A: SMEs are the weakest link in the supply chain (the shortest plank).**
Hackers often don't directly attack well-defended large enterprises; instead, they use SMEs in the supply chain (such as marketing companies or component suppliers) as stepping stones. Currently, the government's cybersecurity budget for SMEs averages only 59 NTD, completely insufficient to build effective defenses. Shoring up this weakness is essential to protecting the entire nation's industrial security.

### Q3: How should we handle cybersecurity risks from Chinese AI software?

**A: Establish testing mechanisms and risk classifications rather than blanket bans.**
Facing Chinese AI tools like DeepSeek, simple prohibition is difficult to enforce and hinders research. Taiwan should establish a national-level AI cybersecurity testing laboratory to conduct "unboxing inspections" of such software, revealing whether they transmit personal data or contain backdoors, and publish risk ratings, allowing citizens and businesses to make informed choices about usage.
