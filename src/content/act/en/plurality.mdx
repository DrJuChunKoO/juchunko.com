# The Declaration of The Plurality

We believe: We conceive that the innovation of democracy in the digital age is not only the application of technology but also a fusion of cultures. Taiwan’s experience has shown us how to establish a secure and free online space through the protection of digital rights, allowing the public to participate and express themselves freely.

Our dream "[Plurality](https://plurality.net)" is not just a display of technology, but a symbiosis of democracy and collaboration. Facing the challenge of the digitalization of democracy, we believe that by integrating technology with the concept of democracy, we can create a society based on mutual trust, allowing the river of democracy to continue winding forward.
