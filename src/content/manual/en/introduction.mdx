## Global Engagement in Technology and Innovation

JC Ko has interviewed several prominent figures in the digital technology sphere on his podcast, which he personally hosts. His guests have included Taiwan’s former Minister of Digital Affairs, Audrey Tang; Radical Markets author, Glen Weyl; and Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin.

He has also been interviewed by major international media outlets, including **The Wall Street Journal**, **The Washington Post**, **Agence France-Presse (AFP)**, and **The New York Times**, on topics related to technology, energy, and national security.

In addition, JC has long focused on virtual assets, blockchain, and emerging technologies.

He subsequently facilitated the successful entry of Tools for Humanity into Taiwan this year.

## Involvement

Regarding my involvement in affairs and platforms related to pluralistic democracy, the story can start from January 2015. Jaclyn Tsai, a minister without portfolio in the Executive Yuan and the initiator of vTaiwan, [invited me and Audrey](https://www.youtube.com/live/kcA3O_6p61k?si=hinBouBNw5Sjzb6E) to teach a class for nearly a hundred senior government officials, sharing the possibilities of digital government and virtual worlds.

At that time, I was also invited to be an advisor for the Executive Yuan's Virtual World Regulatory Adjustment Project and participated in the promotion of [vTaiwan](https://vTaiwan.tw).

In November of the same year (2015), I participated in the planning and production of the 'Talk to Taiwan' online TV show episodes. The first guest of the program this year was [TPP presidential candidate Ko Wen-je](https://www.facebook.com/talkto.tw/videos/644207609015622/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v), and the [current mayor of Taoyuan City, Zhang Shanzheng (KMT)](https://www.facebook.com/talkto.tw/videos/708509565918759/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v), as well as [the current Minister of Digital Affair (moda), Audrey Tang](https://www.facebook.com/talkto.tw/videos/968165243286522/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v), were guests. The goal was to promote more transparent, open, and cross-party policy discussions.

In November 2023, I was recommended by the 129-year-old party - KMT, ranking third on the party's non-constituency legislator nomination list. Following the election results on January 13, 2024 (with the KMT receiving 4,764,293 party votes, accounting for 34.5% of the total), I officially entered the Legislative Yuan on February 1, 2024.

Looking forward, I am excited to promote Plurality in Taiwan together with Glen Weyl and friends from [Plurality](../act/plurality).

## Education

In 2012, he obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Information Engineering from National Taiwan University. Subsequently, he went on to be a postdoctoral researcher at Keio University’s Graduate School of Media Design (KMD) in Japan.

## Experience

He has been a growth partner at Dentsu Group in Taiwan, focusing on AI and Web3 technologies. Additionally, he is the founder of a well-known technology-themed podcast, "[JC in Tech](https://podcasts.apple.com/tw/podcast/%E5%AF%B6%E5%8D%9A%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B%E8%AA%AA/id1484923390)," which continues to thrive.
