## Always Opting for a Hot Americano

JC prefers drinking hot Americano, believing its aroma and rich flavor to be unparalleled compared to other types of coffee.

## Favorite Board Game: Catan

## Favorite Filmmaker: Edward Yang

From the movie "Yi Yi," the protagonist Yang-Yang's famous line, "I want to tell people something they don't know...show them stuff they haven't seen. And I think, that way, every day will be fun." JC wants to show people things they haven't seen!

## Wearing the Same Outfit

There's no harm in buying several pieces of clothing you like and wearing the same outfit every day. Wearing colorful socks, in particular, gives a special sense of power!
