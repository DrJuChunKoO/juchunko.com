## Third Reading Provisions

The Legislative Yuan passed the third reading and amendment of Article 6 of the Control Act for Nuclear Reactor Facilities on May 13, 2025.

### Article 6

After the construction of a nuclear reactor facility is completed, nuclear fuel shall not be loaded unless the competent authority has reviewed and approved the Final Safety Analysis Report, the results of inspections and improvements during construction, and the passing of system functional tests. After nuclear fuel is loaded, the reactor may not enter formal operation unless the competent authority has reviewed and approved the power test results and issued an operating license.

The term of validity for the aforementioned operating license shall not exceed forty years. If continued operation is required after expiration, the operator may apply to the competent authority for license renewal prior to expiration. Operation may not continue without proper license renewal.

If continued operation is necessary after the term of an operating license expires, the operator may apply to the competent authority. Only after the competent authority has confirmed there are no safety concerns and approved license renewal may continued operation be permitted.

The issuance and renewal of operating licenses shall be governed by the provisions of Paragraph 1 of the preceding Article. The renewed operating license shall be valid for a period not exceeding twenty years, starting from the date the license takes effect. The required documentation for applications, review procedures, and other compliance matters shall be stipulated by the competent authority.

## Public Hearing Summary

On May 19, 2025, the Legislative Yuan’s Education and Culture Committee held a public hearing to discuss issues such as amendments to nuclear-related regulations, the extension of nuclear power plant operations, and plant restarts. The meeting aimed to gather diverse opinions and seek consensus for Taiwan’s energy transition.

This public hearing focused on Taiwan's energy transition and the amendment of the “Control Act for Nuclear Reactor Facilities,” discussing the feasibility of extending the operation or restarting nuclear plants, related policies, and societal views. The main topic was “Looking ahead to future technological development and realizing a non-carbon homeland to provide diversified energy options for Taiwan.” The convening committee emphasized the goal of establishing a rational discussion platform that integrates opinions from all sectors as a reference for future legislation.

**Summary of Government Authorities’ Comments:**

- **Ministry of Justice:** Pointed out that nuclear energy and energy policy involve major national interests and environmental safety; broad expert input and the broadest social consensus are needed.
- **Ministry of Economic Affairs:** Expressed respect for the legislature’s authority over legal amendments but emphasized adherence to existing laws and increased communication with society about nuclear waste disposal before any legal changes.
- **Atomic Energy Council:** Stated that it holds no pre-set stance on energy sources; if amendments pass, nuclear plants must conduct safety assessments, organizational restructuring, fuel management, and equipment updates as required. Only after passing rigorous reviews may they apply for license renewal and operation.

### Major Arguments in Favor

1. **Electricity Stability and Economic Competitiveness:** Stable and affordable electricity is considered vital for industry (especially high-tech and AI) and people's livelihoods. Nuclear power offers a stable, economical, and clean electricity source.
2. **Energy Independence and Security:** Taiwan’s energy system is heavily dependent on imports. Nuclear power can enhance energy security and mitigate supply risks related to international geopolitical challenges (e.g., natural gas).
3. **Net-Zero Emissions and Environmental Protection:** Nuclear energy is viewed as a low-carbon, coal-free source that helps reduce air pollution. In contrast, wind and solar have their own environmental controversies.
4. **Technological Progress and Safety Management:** Proponents argue that Taipower and the Atomic Energy Council have the professional capability to ensure safety management. Seismic assessments meet international standards, and new technologies (like SMRs) offer enhanced safety.
5. **International Trends:** Many countries are restarting or extending the operation of nuclear plants; the U.S. even extends up to 80 years. There is an evident global trend toward a “nuclear renaissance.”
6. **Preserving Future Options:** Suggests that laws should be in place in advance to retain policy flexibility in emergencies, even if nuclear power is not used in the short term.
7. **Local Resident Support:** Many residents near nuclear power plants support continued operation, seeing it as a driver for local economic development.

### Major Arguments Against

1. **Safety Concerns:** Critics question the safety of aging reactors and equipment, seeing increased nuclear accident risk. Taiwan is on a seismic belt with active faults near plants; some equipment (like steam generators) is prone to malfunction.
2. **Nuclear Waste Disposal Challenges:** Emphasizes that there is still no final repository solution for high-level radioactive waste, and interim storage is progressing slowly—extension would only increase the burden for future generations.
3. **Regulatory and Administrative Barriers:** Current regulations require advance license renewal, and some units have already entered the decommissioning phase. Amending the law could conflict with existing decommissioning plans.
4. **Inadequate Emergency Preparedness:** Existing emergency response zones are too small. If expanded to international standards, evacuation and sheltering large populations may be unfeasible.
5. **Talent Gap:** There is a gap in the training of nuclear engineers; a shortage of specialized personnel may not meet future needs.
6. **Advocacy for Continued Energy Transition:** It is argued that Taiwan should continue reducing coal, increasing gas, and developing renewables. Renewable energy progresses faster than nuclear, with fewer safety and waste issues, and an accelerated grid upgrade is necessary.
7. **Unresolved Social Controversy:** Nuclear energy is a source of ideological division and lacks substantial societal dialogue and consensus.
8. **Questioning Global Nuclear Trends:** Some believe the share of nuclear energy worldwide is steadily declining, and most countries are turning to renewables rather than nuclear.
