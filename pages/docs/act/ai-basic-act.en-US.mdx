## Taiwan Legislative Yuan’s First “AI Basic Act” Public Hearing — Driving AI Innovation and Ushering in a New Digital Era

On April 16, 2025, Legislator 葛如鈞 (Ko Ju-Chun) together with the KMT think tank, convened the Legislative Yuan’s historic first public hearing on the “AI Basic Act” draft. This event marks the beginning of Taiwan’s AI legal era. In response to the rapid global advancement of AI technologies and dramatic changes across society, economy, industry, and the legal system, Taiwan must take timely action to legislate an “innovation-driven, safety- and equality-oriented” AI law, laying a robust foundation for industrial transformation, international integration, and digital democracy.

### Four Key Pillars of the Draft Act — Laying Out Taiwan's AI Blueprint

#### 1. Development-Oriented: Innovation Above All

The draft designates the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) as lead authority, emphasizing development, innovation, and R&D. Beyond foreseeing AI risks, Taiwan must fuel industrial upgrading, academia-industry collaboration, talent cultivation, and infrastructure—seizing the global wave of AI legal reform.

#### 2. International Alignment: Risk-Based Supervision

The draft draws from the EU AI Act, U.S. executive orders, Canadian regulations, and international norms to establish a traceable, verifiable risk-based AI management system. Government will supervise according to different scenarios (such as healthcare, finance, education, transportation), balancing innovation with public trust and global credibility.

#### 3. Open Data & Cultural Sovereignty

Government is called upon to open/share data and boost secondary use, with an emphasis on native Traditional Chinese corpora to avoid overreliance on foreign datasets. Data openness is fundamental for AI innovation, diverse applications, and public oversight—preventing data monopolies.

#### 4. Digital Inclusion: Narrowing the Digital Divide

The draft focuses on AI and digital education resources for remote areas, the underprivileged, and indigenous peoples. Government is required to proactively close digital gaps, enabling everyone to share in the benefits of smart technology.

### Defining Accountability: NSTC Leads Development, MODA Assists Regulation

NSTC’s technology and innovation leadership gives it a forward-looking edge to upgrade Taiwan’s AI sector; MODA (Ministry of Digital Affairs) focuses on risk management and cybersecurity support. Long-term planning based on technological needs will prevent policy drift.

### Why Taiwan Needs the AI Basic Act

- Without harmonized legal frameworks, Taiwan’s industries struggle to integrate and compete globally.
- Major countries have enacted AI-specific laws; without legislative action, Taiwan risks “running naked in the AI wave,” missing opportunities and unable to mitigate future risks.
- Robust legal foundations enable AI education, innovation, data governance, and digital rights, helping Taiwan advance beyond a hardware-based economy.
- This people-oriented draft promotes partnership across academia, industry, and government, building an equitable and innovative AI ecosystem.

#### Key Provisions Snapshot

- NSTC is clearly established as the competent authority.
- Creation of an AI Strategic Committee, led by the Premier, to coordinate state-wide.
- Full coverage of open data, language/cultural sovereignty, personal data, funding, industry investment, and universal education.
- Strengthened international cooperation, regulatory adaptation, and comprehensive risk governance.
- Every article centers on balancing innovation with human rights protection.
