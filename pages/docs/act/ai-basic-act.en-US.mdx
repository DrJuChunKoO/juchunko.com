## Taiwan’s First Legislative Public Hearing on the “AI Basic Act”: Driving AI Innovation and Shaping the New Digital Era

On April 16, 2025, Legislator Ju-Chun KO, in collaboration with the KMT think tank, hosted Taiwan’s very first public hearing on the draft “AI Basic Act” at the Legislative Yuan, marking the official start of Taiwan’s AI legal development. Responding to the global surge in AI technology and significant changes across society, economy, industry, and law, Taiwan must keep up with trends by formulating an AI-specific act centered on “development, balanced with safety and equality.” This paves the way for industry transformation, international linkage, and strong digital democracy.

### Four Major Focuses of the Draft: Building a Blueprint for Taiwan’s AI Development

#### 1. Development-Oriented, with Innovation as the Key

The draft makes it clear that the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) shall be the competent authority, highlighting the central roles of development, innovation, and R&D. Beyond anticipating potential AI risks, Taiwan must strive to upgrade industries, foster academia-industry collaboration, cultivate talent, and invest in infrastructure. Taiwan has long prioritized hardware over software, resulting in a slow start compared to international peers. Facing a new global wave of AI laws—led by the US, EU, Japan, and South Korea—Taiwan must not miss this crucial opportunity.

#### 2. International Alignment and a Risk-Based Regulatory System

This draft draws upon the EU AI Act, US executive orders, Canadian regulations, and other international benchmarks, advocating for a traceable, verifiable risk-based AI management regime. The government will promote innovation while applying appropriate regulation depending on the application context (such as healthcare, finance, education, transportation), enhancing Taiwan’s credibility in international cooperation and safeguarding public trust and safety.

#### 3. Enhanced Data Openness and Protection of Language and Cultural Sovereignty

The draft requires government efforts to promote data openness, sharing, and reuse—especially emphasizing the autonomous training of Traditional Chinese corpora. This avoids excessive reliance on overseas data, which may lead to cultural infiltration or ideological bias. Open data is also the foundation of AI innovation, diverse applications, and broad civic oversight, ensuring Taiwan’s AI progress is not monopolized by a handful of major platforms or foreign data sources.

#### 4. Digital Equality to Bridge Technological Gaps

The draft pays special attention to digital education resources and AI opportunities for disadvantaged groups, such as people in rural areas, those with disabilities, the economically underprivileged, and indigenous peoples. The government is tasked to proactively bridge regional digital divides, sharing the benefits of smart technology with everyone. AI advancement must not be exclusive to metropolitan areas or major industries. True “human-centered” progress means every citizen can improve their quality of life, work efficiency, and realize their potential through AI.

### Lead Authority Positioning: NSTC as Development Leader, MODA as Regulatory Partner

As AI becomes a key pillar of national competitiveness, the assignment of the competent authority will shape Taiwan’s AI development trajectory. Ju-Chun KO emphasizes: **development over supervision, innovation over restriction**. NSTC, with expertise in technology funding, R&D innovation, and cross-ministerial communication, is best suited to lead Taiwan’s AI industry forward. In contrast, the Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) has mainly focused on regulation and cybersecurity, without the drive for industrial innovation. MODA’s role should be risk and cybersecurity support. The positioning of the lead agency should be planned with long-term technological development in mind to avoid loss of development direction.

### Why Does Taiwan Need an “AI Basic Act”?

- Hardware exports without supporting regulatory foundation hinder industrial integration and international cooperation.
- Leading nations, like the EU and US, have established AI acts. Without its own, Taiwan risks “racing naked through the AI wave”—unable to seize new opportunities or address future risks.
- A sound legal system enables AI education, technological innovation, data governance, and digital rights, transforming Taiwan from a “hardware factory” into a “smart nation.”
- This draft starts from “people’s livelihoods,” encouraging public-private-academia collaboration for a fair, diverse, and innovative AI ecosystem.

#### Key Provisions Overview

- **Explicitly designates NSTC as the lead authority to ensure development-orientation.**
- **Establishes a Special AI Strategic Committee, chaired by the Premier, to coordinate cross-ministerial efforts.**
- **Comprehensive coverage: open data, language sovereignty, personal data protection, budget allocation, industry investment, and widespread educational efforts.**
- **Strengthens international cooperation, legal adaptation, and robust risk governance, connecting Taiwan with global regulations.**
- **Every article upholds “balanced development, innovation, and human rights protection” as the core principle.**

### Ju-Chun KO’s Stance

> “Taiwan’s AI industry must lead rather than just regulate—strongly driving R&D and encouraging innovation. If the authority’s sole focus is control and boundaries, Taiwan will always be stuck in place amid the AI trend. The future of AI should be led by the innovative force of NSTC, with government, industry, and academia working together.”

> “This ‘AI Basic Act’ is Taiwan’s AI constitution for the next ten years—prioritizing development, shared equity, data autonomy, and investment, ensuring Taiwan does not lose its way or lag in the global AI competition. I invite everyone to safeguard Taiwan’s future technological competitiveness together!”
