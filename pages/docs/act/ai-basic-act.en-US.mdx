## Timeline and Key Controversies in the Promotion of Taiwan’s “AI Basic Law”

### Focus Areas in Legislative Interpellations

- **Unclear Division of Regulatory Responsibilities:** The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) has both research funding and organizational capacity, yet it has repeatedly been questioned for “passing the buck” of AI governance responsibilities to the Ministry of Digital Affairs. This has led to concerns about an imbalance between development and regulation.
- **Lack of Transparency in Decision-Making Process:** The Executive Yuan’s decision on February 26 lacked official meeting records or supporting documents. Lawmakers have called for complete openness and transparency in the entire decision-making process.
- **Widespread Concerns in Industry and Academia:** If the Ministry of Digital Affairs—an agency of the third tier—becomes the competent authority, it may lack sufficient manpower and budget, and may not be able to fully implement policy. This could impact Taiwan’s international AI competitiveness and talent pipeline.
- **High Attention to Data Sovereignty, Local Language Data, and Open Data:** The development of AI technology should safeguard traditional Chinese and the unique characteristics of Taiwanese culture. The government is expected to establish a national-level open data and AI training data repository.

### 2025

- **February 6, 2025**
  **[Executive Yuan Press Conference]** The Executive Yuan Deputy Minister explained, “The draft of the AI Basic Law has been submitted for review by the Executive Yuan and will be revised promptly and submitted for legislative review before the next session.”

- **February 26, 2025**
  　**[Major Turning Point]** The Executive Yuan, without a public resolution at its formal meeting, suddenly instructed that the "draft bill would be overseen by the Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA)."

  - Question: February 26 was not an official Executive Yuan meeting day, raising concerns about decision-making transparency.
  - [CNA Report](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/afe/202504230387.aspx) Supplement: According to a CNA report on April 23, 2025, MODA explained that the Executive Yuan formally instructed, on February 26, that MODA would be responsible for promoting legislation and providing further interpretation of the AI Basic Law draft. The draft is expected to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review after approval by the Executive Yuan. The draft was originally proposed by the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) last year, made available for public comment from July 15 to September 13, 2024, and reviewed at an Executive Yuan meeting on November 22, 2024, with a request for revisions before resubmission.

- **April 23, 2025**
  　**[MODA Briefs the Media on Progress]** MODA stated that, as instructed by the Executive Yuan on February 26, the draft is under MODA’s leadership, now placing more emphasis on its regulatory role: "balancing the encouragement of innovation with regulation."

  - [CNA Report](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/afe/202504230387.aspx) Supplement: On April 23, MODA further explained that the draft would be responsive to the needs of Taiwan’s industry and society, adhering to the core principles of "encouraging innovation while upholding human rights," and guiding government agencies to develop and promote AI applications. The draft is not a "regulatory law" per se, but rather sets out principles for AI development and policy integration. Detailed regulations (such as data management and AI risk classification) will be advanced later through subordinate legislation.

- **April 29, 2025**
  **[Education Committee General Interpellation]**
  Legislators questioned whether the initial “R&D-focused, regulation as support” approach would shift to a “regulation-oriented” one; raised concerns over the Ministry of Digital Affairs’ capacity (as a third-tier agency) in terms of staff and budget; and criticized the opaque decision-making process, demanding the Executive Yuan clarify its decision-making transparency.
  Questions also addressed open data, sovereign AI, AI training databases, and energy policy (including nuclear power development).

## Taiwan Legislative Yuan’s First “AI Basic Act” Public Hearing — Driving AI Innovation and Ushering in a New Digital Era

On April 16, 2025, Legislator 葛如鈞 (Ko Ju-Chun) together with the KMT think tank, convened the Legislative Yuan’s historic first public hearing on the “AI Basic Act” draft. This event marks the beginning of Taiwan’s AI legal era. In response to the rapid global advancement of AI technologies and dramatic changes across society, economy, industry, and the legal system, Taiwan must take timely action to legislate an “innovation-driven, safety- and equality-oriented” AI law, laying a robust foundation for industrial transformation, international integration, and digital democracy.

### Four Key Pillars of the Draft Act — Laying Out Taiwan's AI Blueprint

#### 1. Development-Oriented: Innovation Above All

The draft designates the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) as lead authority, emphasizing development, innovation, and R&D. Beyond foreseeing AI risks, Taiwan must fuel industrial upgrading, academia-industry collaboration, talent cultivation, and infrastructure—seizing the global wave of AI legal reform.

#### 2. International Alignment: Risk-Based Supervision

The draft draws from the EU AI Act, U.S. executive orders, Canadian regulations, and international norms to establish a traceable, verifiable risk-based AI management system. Government will supervise according to different scenarios (such as healthcare, finance, education, transportation), balancing innovation with public trust and global credibility.

#### 3. Open Data & Cultural Sovereignty

Government is called upon to open/share data and boost secondary use, with an emphasis on native Traditional Chinese corpora to avoid overreliance on foreign datasets. Data openness is fundamental for AI innovation, diverse applications, and public oversight—preventing data monopolies.

#### 4. Digital Inclusion: Narrowing the Digital Divide

The draft focuses on AI and digital education resources for remote areas, the underprivileged, and indigenous peoples. Government is required to proactively close digital gaps, enabling everyone to share in the benefits of smart technology.

---

### Defining Accountability: NSTC Leads Development, MODA Assists Regulation

NSTC’s technology and innovation leadership gives it a forward-looking edge to upgrade Taiwan’s AI sector; MODA (Ministry of Digital Affairs) focuses on risk management and cybersecurity support. Long-term planning based on technological needs will prevent policy drift.

---

### Why Taiwan Needs the AI Basic Act

- Without harmonized legal frameworks, Taiwan’s industries struggle to integrate and compete globally.
- Major countries have enacted AI-specific laws; without legislative action, Taiwan risks “running naked in the AI wave,” missing opportunities and unable to mitigate future risks.
- Robust legal foundations enable AI education, innovation, data governance, and digital rights, helping Taiwan advance beyond a hardware-based economy.
- This people-oriented draft promotes partnership across academia, industry, and government, building an equitable and innovative AI ecosystem.

#### Key Provisions Snapshot

- NSTC is clearly established as the competent authority.
- Creation of an AI Strategic Committee, led by the Premier, to coordinate state-wide.
- Full coverage of open data, language/cultural sovereignty, personal data, funding, industry investment, and universal education.
- Strengthened international cooperation, regulatory adaptation, and comprehensive risk governance.
- Every article centers on balancing innovation with human rights protection.
