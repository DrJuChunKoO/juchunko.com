#### [Volatile Exchange Rates Favor "Digital Gold": Ju-Chun KO Suggests Bitcoin Should Be Included in National Reserves](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20250509002430-260407) `‰∏≠ÊôÇÊñ∞ËÅûÁ∂≤`

Facing the intensifying international geopolitical risks, Kuomintang legislator Ju-Chun KO emphasized at the National Policy Forum today that Taiwan, as an export-driven economy, is challenged by the recent volatility of the New Taiwan dollar, impacting economic stability. He noted that Taiwan holds 423 metric tons of gold reserves and approximately $577 billion in foreign exchange, over 90% of which is invested in U.S. Treasury bonds. 

KO suggested that Bitcoin could serve as a digital alternative to traditional assets and called for Taiwan to consider a diversified reserve structure to prepare for future uncertainties. He highlighted Bitcoin's fixed supply and decentralized nature, which presents it as a candidate for "digital gold." He cited research indicating a significant correlation between Bitcoin and gold during financial market fluctuations, reinforcing Bitcoin's hedging properties.

Furthermore, he referenced the U.S. government's inclusion of Bitcoin in its national reserves and the initiatives of various states to incorporate Bitcoin in governmental reserve strategies. He pointed out that in Taiwan, former Premier Chen Chien-jen acknowledged Bitcoin as an anti-inflation asset. KO stresses that while he does not advocate for Bitcoin as the sole solution, its inclusion in a diversified asset portfolio could enhance Taiwan's economic resilience and risk management capabilities.

Ju-Chun KO, a legislator from the Kuomintang, highlighted the challenges faced by Taiwan's economy due to increased international geopolitical risks at a forum in the Legislative Yuan. He noted that the recent fluctuations in the New Taiwan Dollar, alongside Taiwan's significant gold reserves and foreign exchange holdings, pose a threat to economic stability. 

KO suggested considering innovative financial instruments like Bitcoin, which he described as a "digital gold" with properties that could help hedge against inflation and market volatility. He referenced research indicating Bitcoin's correlation with gold during market upheavals and pointed to various U.S. states including New Hampshire and Arizona that are exploring the inclusion of Bitcoin in their reserve strategies.

He emphasized that while he does not advocate Bitcoin as the sole solution, it should be included in a diversified asset portfolio to enhance Taiwan‚Äôs financial resilience. His comments align with those of former Executive Yuan Director Chen Chung, asserting that Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply gives it advantages over traditional monetary policies. KO urged Taiwan to proactively develop a diversified reserve framework to be better prepared for future uncertainties.

#### [Trump's Proposed Movie Tariff Could Impact Taiwan: Li Yuan Urges Proactive Measures to Address Changes](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20250507002600-260405) `‰∏≠ÊôÇÊñ∞ËÅûÁ∂≤`

U.S. President Trump is reportedly considering imposing a 100% tariff on films produced overseas, which could have significant impacts on Taiwan's cultural industry. Taiwan's Minister of Culture, Lee Yuan, expressed concerns during a legislative session, stating that the Ministry has initiated preemptive measures to address potential challenges.

Legislator Ko Rujun highlighted that 99 American films were released in Taiwan in the first quarter of this year, suggesting that these figures should be considered in U.S.-Taiwan tariff negotiations to strengthen Taiwan's position. However, Lee mentioned that the Cultural Ministry is not part of the negotiating team addressing the tariffs, which poses a major challenge for the cultural sector. 

Internal meetings have been held to discuss culture trade issues with the U.S., with the goal of identifying risks and formulating response strategies to ensure the stability and growth of Taiwan's cultural industry. Lee noted that Taiwan's film market had struggled since the U.S. fully opened its film imports in 2002, almost disappearing before gradually recovering to a 16% market share by 2011.

He concluded that Trump's tariff policy could indeed affect Taiwan's cultural exports and international collaborations, and the Ministry will continue to monitor the situation and prepare accordingly to maintain industry stability.

#### [Poll Released by the Kuomintang: Nearly 60% Believe Lai's Government Only Focuses on Recall Movements, Lacking Economic Storm Response](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20250507002313-260407) `‰∏≠ÊôÇÊñ∞ËÅûÁ∂≤`

The Kuomintang (KMT) held a press conference today (7th) to release the latest poll results, revealing that nearly 60% (57.2%) of the public believes the Lai government is unable to produce effective measures to face the global economic crisis and is merely engaged in political mobilization. The poll also indicated that around 70% (67.7%) of respondents expressed "not very supportive" or "strongly opposed" views regarding the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) non-nuclear homeland policy.

KMT's Deputy Executive Director of the National Policy Foundation, Ling Tao, noted that amidst the significant appreciation of the New Taiwan Dollar and U.S. tariffs, many criticize the government for failing to provide effective responses. Notably, 32.8% strongly agree with the notion that the government is focused on political mobilization rather than addressing the economic crisis.

KMT Legislator Ke Ru-jun emphasized that regarding the DPP's promotion of a non-nuclear homeland, the future energy supply in Taiwan will rely heavily on thermal power, with almost 70% (67.7%) indicating they do not support this transition. Following the shutdown of the nuclear power plant on May 17, thermal power could account for up to 83-85% of electricity generation, primarily relying on imports, which raises concerns about energy resilience and national security.

Ling further commented on the severe fluctuations in exchange rates, stating that President Lai and the Central Bank Governor claimed that the New Taiwan Dollar's appreciation is not under external pressure, a stance contradicted by the South Korean central bank‚Äôs head. The public‚Äôs trust in the government has noticeably diminished, reaching a point of widespread dissatisfaction.

This survey, commissioned by the KMT and conducted by the Shih Fan Polling Company from May 2 to 5, included 1,102 valid samples and had a margin of error of ¬±2.95% at a 95% confidence level.

#### ["Negotiation with the Kneeling Tribe: Ge Rujun on Exchange Rate Fluctuations Exposing the Central Bank's Dysfunction and Insufficient Financial Resilience"](https://udn.com/news/story/124438/8720877?from=udn-ch1_breaknews-1-99-news) `UDN`

The recent surge in the New Taiwan Dollar (NTD), which temporarily soared past 30 NTD to 1 USD, has prompted alarm over volatile exchange rates. Kuomintang legislator Ge Rujun criticized the Democratic Progressive Party's government for making concessions in international negotiations, which he claims has led to economic instability and a decline in local industries. He expressed concern that while the NTD's appreciation might attract foreign investment in the short term, it also poses significant risks. Investors may exit quickly when gains diminish, potentially harming the capital market and local businesses.

Ge highlighted issues faced by local retailers due to banking app failures, indicating underlying problems in Taiwan‚Äôs financial system during periods of stress. He urged the government to expedite digital financial transformation, including adopting blockchain technology and stablecoins for efficient cross-border transactions.

He further criticized the Central Bank for excluding Bitcoin from foreign reserves due to volatility concerns, noting that NTD volatility currently surpasses that of Bitcoin. Ge called for a diversified asset strategy to enhance financial resilience, referencing a recent Arizona law allowing a portion of state funds to invest in Bitcoin, suggesting Taiwan should create a similar framework for digital assets. He emphasized the need for clear regulatory responsibilities for stablecoins and digital assets to ensure a more secure and diversified economic future.

#### [New Taiwan Dollar Soars Continuously; Tech Legislator Ge Ru-Jun Suggests Including Bitcoin as Part of Strategic Reserves](https://www.nownews.com/news/6679673) `‰ªäÊó•Êñ∞ËÅû`

Taiwan's New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) recently surged, breaking through the 30 NTD to 1 USD barrier, and even temporarily reaching 28.812 NTD. KMT legislator Ge Ru-jun criticized the DPP government's "kneeling negotiation" approach, blaming it for Taiwan's weakened economic position and the volatility of the exchange rate. He suggested that the government and the central bank should consider diversifying their asset reserves, including the discussion of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. 

Ge emphasized that while the NTD's appreciation might attract foreign investment in the short term, it poses significant risks, as foreign capital could quickly exit once the currency's upward momentum ceases. He shared concerns about the financial system's instability, pointing to a recent incident where banking applications crashed, preventing transactions and highlighting the need for improved financial resilience.

Ge called for the government to urgently address the transformation of digital finance by promoting blockchain technology and stablecoin applications to enhance cross-border financial efficiency. He noted that despite the central bank refusing to include Bitcoin in its foreign exchange reserves due to volatility, recent data shows the NTD's volatility is significantly higher than Bitcoin's, indicating inconsistency in the bank's policies.

Additionally, he cited a recent bill passed in Arizona allowing investments in Bitcoin and digital assets, advocating for Taiwan to establish its own system for digital asset reserves to reduce concentrated risks. He urged the government to hold inter-departmental meetings to clarify regulatory responsibilities for stablecoins and digital assets, advocating for a diverse strategic reserve approach as a response to current crises and future economic stability.

Ko also highlighted a recent incident where customers faced difficulties completing transactions due to banking app failures, indicating confusion in both online and physical transactions. He called for the government to recognize the urgent need for digital financial transformation and promote blockchain technology and stablecoin applications to enhance financial resilience.

Additionally, he pointed out contradictions in the central bank's approach, noting that while it rejected including Bitcoin in its foreign reserve strategy due to high volatility, recent data shows that the NTD's volatility exceeds Bitcoin's by nearly three times. Ko urged the government and central bank to consider more diversified asset reserves, including Bitcoin, to mitigate future risks.

He emphasized the high concentration of Taiwan‚Äôs foreign reserves in a single currency, calling for a cross-ministerial meeting to clarify the regulatory responsibilities for stablecoins and digital assets, aiming for a more diversified strategic reserve to ensure economic security.

#### [Civic Group Calls for Nuclear Power Extension, Taipower Responds](https://www.setn.com/News.aspx?NewsID=1649579&utm_campaign=viewallnews) `‰∏âÁ´ãÊñ∞ËÅû`

Today, a nuclear energy advocacy group protested at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, calling for the extension of nuclear power operations to save Taiwan Power Company (Taipower). Taipower expressed respect for diverse opinions and stressed that power stability should be the primary societal consensus. However, relying solely on nuclear power ignores challenges related to nuclear safety, waste management, and societal consensus, and cannot be resolved merely through referendums or legislative changes.

The Kuomintang party held a press conference advocating for the extension of the No. 2 reactor at the Third Nuclear Power Plant to maintain energy security and stable electricity prices, aligning with Taiwan's international carbon reduction commitments.

Taipower highlighted that the recent spike in fuel prices due to the Russia-Ukraine war has been a major cause of their financial losses, affecting nuclear-powered countries as well. It urged support for special budgets to stabilize finances and ensure reliable electricity supply.

Currently, nuclear power accounts for only about 3% of Taiwan's energy mix, which limits its impact on power supply and finance. Taipower advocates for a balanced energy approach, utilizing existing low-carbon gas, renewable energy, and hydroelectric sources, along with new large power units to provide stable base load electricity.

In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, Taipower noted significant reductions since 2016 due to policies promoting gas over coal and improving air pollution control. Furthermore, Taipower is undertaking projects to replace coal units with gas units, aiming for a transition away from coal by the end of 2034.

Regarding calls for disclosing night reserve capacity rates, Taipower explained that reserve capacity reflects surplus power during peak loads, with considerations for renewable energy impacts. The government has established a management office to review supply reliability and the announcement mechanism.

On November 1, the Legislative Yuan reviewed the progress of the Media Bargaining Law, with several legislators questioning the government's passive attitude and expressing concerns about its impact on the media industry and press freedom. Taiwan People's Party legislator Chang Chih-kai criticized the government for negligence and demanded the swift passage of the Media Bargaining Law. Kuomintang legislator Ko Ru-jun warned that the legislation could hinder international negotiations and affect the development of AI in Taiwan due to restricted media data access. Minister of Digital Affairs, Audrey Tang, responded that the bill is being carefully planned and will remain in contact with the tariff team as the construction of the AI database progresses.

Chang highlighted that digital platforms like Google and Meta have long utilized Taiwanese media content without reasonable compensation, warning that further government inaction could threaten democracy. He urged for the completion of the legislation and lifting the restrictions on joint media bargaining under the Fair Trade Act.

Chang mentioned that last year, several media outlets called for legislative action, and the People's Party's draft bill includes three main proposals: revealing news traffic, disclosing algorithm logic, and prohibiting unannounced changes in news presentation.

Ko warned that if the Media Bargaining Law is not coordinated in advance, it could be seen as a trade barrier by the U.S., provoking tariff retaliation. He suggested that the Executive Yuan should coordinate the establishment of an AI corpus database and create an open-source office to prevent Taiwan from lagging in global tech competition.

In response to the inquiries, Minister Tang stated that the government is observing Australia's experiences with the Media Bargaining Law and is cautiously assessing it in connection with tariff negotiations. Executive Secretary of the Fair Trade Commission, Mao Hao-chi, noted that joint bargaining among the media would receive assistance under a specific exception in the Fair Trade Act.

The Director of the Department of Diverse Innovation, Chuang Ming-fen, indicated that the government currently has 50,000 open data sets and is working with the Intellectual Property Office to formulate licensing terms for the sovereignty AI corpus, expected to be internally discussed by early May for potential external announcement based on feasibility.

Ko argued that the core issue in tariff negotiations is U.S. debt, as the government is under pressure from debt servicing costs. While the U.S. seeks to encourage other countries to buy more American products, these issues may not be completely separate during negotiations. He cautioned that Taiwan has already lost its semiconductor advantage, as major companies, including TSMC, have invested heavily in the U.S. despite previous government assurances to keep operations in Taiwan.

He criticized the quality of the official documents, expressing frustration over the extended time to summarize them.

Additionally, Lin responded to criticism about the reports, noting that many documents were disorganized proposals, not formally approved reports.

On April 19, a blue-supporting group gathered at the Taipei square, claiming over 50,000 attendees. However, tech-savvy legislator Ko Rujun estimated that only a few thousand were present using AI analysis. Green camp supporters lamented the insular echo chamber among pro-Green factions, questioning the effectiveness of current strategies to attract centrist voters.

They conducted an experiment, noting that they had no awareness of the event unless actively informed by contacts.

Others commented on the division instigated by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) using anti-communism as a tool to consolidate power and eliminate dissent within Taiwan.

In Taiwan, to regulate nuclear reactor facilities and ensure public safety, the "Nuclear Reactor Facility Regulation Act" was enacted in 2003. According to Article 6, the operating license for nuclear reactors is valid for a maximum of 40 years, and if an extension is desired, it must be applied for 5 to 15 years before the license expires.

Due to former President Ma Ying-jeou's announcement in 2011 that the first three nuclear plants would not seek extensions, and President Tsai Ing-wen's promotion of a "non-nuclear" energy transition policy, all three nuclear power plants are undergoing decommissioning. The latest to operate, the Nuclear Power Plant No. 3, has submitted a decommissioning plan without plans for an extension, set to halt operations on May 17, 2025.

As Taiwan approaches this non-nuclear era, voices calling to maintain nuclear power have increased, leading the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party to propose various amendments to the original regulation to extend the operational life of nuclear facilities from 40 to 60 years. During a legislative meeting led by KMT member Ge Ru-jun, the parties decided to review related amendment drafts without recording attendees to keep discussions low-profile.

The discussion raises a critical question: if the extension of nuclear operations is seen as beneficial for climate change response and public health by providing stable electricity and reducing pollution, why are they hesitant to officially endorse their proposals? This reluctance suggests a disconnect between their actions and public accountability.

The idea of an AI Basic Law was first put forward by former legislator Hsu Yu-jen in 2019 but did not pass. With the growth of generative AI, Ko, in collaboration with the Kuomintang think tank, has revived the initiative. The draft, compiled with insights from the International Research Foundation for AI Law, reflects a broad consensus in Taiwan about establishing a legal framework for AI.

Ko proposed that the Ministry of Science and Technology should oversee the regulation rather than the Ministry of Digital Affairs, filling the gap that current drafts focus more on risk management than development. The government is urged to invest in AI infrastructure, provide research and development subsidies, and establish a National AI Strategy Committee to coordinate efforts across departments.

He called for Taiwan to reference regulations from the EU and the US to create a verifiable risk classification framework for the safety and trustworthiness of various AI applications. The draft also emphasizes the need for open data sharing, promotes the use of traditional Chinese data for AI training, and aims to ensure equal access to AI education resources for rural areas and marginalized groups, fostering an equitable technology environment.

On March 21, the Presidential Office announced the central government's budget plan, allowing various ministries to initiate budget thawing processes. However, as of today, no thawing reports have been received by the Legislative Yuan's committees. KMT legislators Niuxu Ting, Wu Zongxian, and Ge Rujun held a press conference on the 11th, questioning the executive branch for intentionally not submitting any reports. They accused the DPP of manipulating public opinion and stoking tensions related to an impending recall vote.

Niuxu Ting, chairman of the Internal Affairs Committee, pointed out that budget cuts and freezes should be distinct processes, stating that as long as a reasonable written report is submitted, it should be processed. He criticized the executive branch for not submitting any proposals, claiming the DPP's assertions of a budget shortfall were deceptive.

Wu Zongxian, chairman of the Judicial and Legal Committee, emphasized that the legislature's duty is to safeguard the budget and criticized any disregard for oversight. He suggested that if the executive branch believed resources were insufficient, they should legally propose supplementary or special budgets instead of ignoring the issue.

Ge Rujun also raised concerns about the DPP breaking from past practices by specifically targeting frequently frozen ministries, such as the Ministry of Culture and Academia Sinica. He questioned the motivations behind this change and urged for transparency in the process by releasing a website tool to monitor the thawing proposals and committee progress, inviting public oversight.

In summary, KMT lawmakers are strongly criticizing the DPP for failing to process budget thawing proposals, suggesting it may be a politically motivated tactic in light of upcoming recall elections.

U.S. President Trump announced a 90-day delay in high tariff measures, which includes Taiwan in the deferral list. Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-long emphasized this additional time allows for more detailed discussions on economic cooperation, proposing a "Taiwan-U.S. coalition." President Lai Ching-te reiterated Taiwan's close economic partnership with the U.S. and the goal of achieving zero tariffs. Discussions are ongoing regarding Taiwan's investments in various industries beyond semiconductors, potentially in manufacturing sectors.

Luo Junxuan, the Vice President of the Taiwan Northern Society, criticizes the opposition parties, primarily the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People‚Äôs Party, for their inadequate responses to the significant trade tax policies introduced by former President Trump. He argues that as Taiwan faces unprecedented global economic turbulence, the reactions from these parties reveal a lack of competence and a failure to take responsibility.

He contends that such behavior raises doubts about their capability to govern and support Taiwan's interests effectively in international affairs.

In response to the risks and pressures from the Sino-U.S. technology war, Taiwanese industries, international negotiations, and policy arrangements have become focal points of public attention. Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun is expected to lead negotiations, with rumors suggesting invitations to semiconductor industry leaders like Morris Chang, sparking social discussions. Kuomintang legislator Ko Ch≈´n pointed out that in this historic international game, the focus should not be on specific individuals but should instead embrace a wide array of elites, implying that even President Tsai Ing-wen could be a candidate. He emphasized the need for discussions that reflect Taiwan's interests rather than sticking to past choices.

Ko noted that while President Lai Ching-te's recent remarks in international media were delayed, they highlighted crucial issues such as non-tariff barriers, particularly currency manipulation. He expressed concern that the creative approach of the President communicating through international media might indicate a lack of normal channels for official statements, urging the need for strategic thinking. Despite a 90-day tariff pause from the U.S., he warned that policies could change rapidly, and semiconductor tariffs remain an unresolved issue.

He asserted that Taiwan should pay attention to emerging technologies like blockchain and AI, and that the government needs to clarify its direction, particularly regarding energy procurement and nuclear power policies. Ko criticized the DPP for insufficiently addressing issues related to TSMC‚Äôs operations in the U.S. and the long-term structural problems of Taiwan‚Äôs industry while relying on outdated personnel and strategies.

Taiwan's economy has steadily risen, with the GDP increasing tenfold over the past years. However, the salary of teachers remains stagnant, failing to keep pace with inflation. Legislator Ko Rujun pointed out that hourly wages for part-time and substitute teachers in public schools have seen minimal adjustments over the last 35 years. Specifically, high school teachers' pay increased by only 20 NT dollars, middle school by 18, and elementary school by 76 NT dollars, prompting urgent calls for government reform. The Ministry of Education has promised to submit a review report within a month.

According to statistics, the hourly wages for teachers in the 114 academic year are 420 NT dollars for high school, 378 for middle school, and 336 for elementary school. Ko criticized these increases as insufficient, stating that such growth does not align with the current economic and inflationary environment, questioning the reasonableness of these minor adjustments.

Ko further emphasized the impact of economic instability and inflation on consumer behavior, particularly concerning educational costs. He warned that if parents face unemployment or reduced income, spending on tutoring and meals for children may decline, affecting educational outcomes. He stressed that the education sector is vulnerable amidst family economic turmoil and that stable teacher support is crucial for students' welfare.

Ko criticized the notion that teachers are "society's beacons" when their compensation is too low to even buy a pen. He urged that the adjustment of hourly wages must reflect a commitment to education and called on the Ministry of Education to reassess teacher compensation to restore dignity and support within the educational system.

The Kuomintang (KMT) urged the ruling party to cease internal political strife and unite the public to navigate this challenging situation. KMT legislator Ko Rujun criticized President Lai Ching-te's initial response to focus solely on "strong negotiations" and suggested that the government should proactively engage in negotiations for better trade deals with the U.S. and invest in diversifying markets.

In response to the recent tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) held a press conference to propose several concrete suggestions for the government. KMT spokesman Yang Zhi-yu criticized President Lai Ching-te's five strategies as lacking direction and urged unity to navigate the challenges ahead.

Legislator Ko Ru-jun suggested that the government should proactively negotiate with the U.S. to seek better trade agreements and reduce currency manipulation in exchange for lower tariffs on Taiwanese goods. He advocated for market diversification and the acceleration of Taiwanese investments in the U.S. to demonstrate goodwill. Ko also emphasized the need to invest in technology development and automation within the electronics industry to maintain competitiveness.

Lin Tzu-chia from the National Policy Foundation highlighted that the U.S. tariffs are primarily based on Taiwan's export surplus data, which could be contested given its rapid export growth. He recommended increasing military purchases from the U.S. to negotiate for reduced tariffs but noted the need for legislative approval for any tariff changes.

Lin further stated that due to uncertainties regarding tariffs, long-term investment decisions in the U.S. should be cautious. He proposed Taiwan seek membership in the CPTPP or negotiate FTAs with other countries to mitigate reliance on the U.S. market, and called for President Lai to convene a national conference for bipartisan discussions on economic strategies.

Ko emphasized the need for the government to address the situation rationally without political conflicts and reminded citizens to take collective action to voice their concerns. The KMT is ready to engage in discussions with the government to formulate effective responses.

1. Negotiate with the U.S. to gain tariff adjustment opportunities.
2. Diversify markets by encouraging businesses to shift towards Southeast Asia, Europe, and India, while supporting Taiwanese firms in establishing factories in the U.S.
3. Invest in industry upgrading and digital transformation to enhance products' value and competitiveness.
4. Localize supply chains and promote regional cooperation by collaborating with international firms.
5. Strengthen financial oversight to ensure fair and transparent resource distribution.

He warned that such actions could be seen as signs of weakness domestically, and questioned the efficacy of relying solely on procurement and investment to gain US concessions without addressing the issue of long-term tariffs. He emphasized the need for clarity on subsidy continuation and transparent communication regarding exchange rates to gain international support and counter manipulation suspicions.

He warned that the public's discontent is growing, and the opening of the stock market on Monday will be crucial for the DPP, especially since U.S. markets have reacted sharply to the tariffs, with significant losses in major companies. He expressed concern that the government might not be able to stabilize the market if it crashes and suggested many companies might bypass Taiwan's investment review to invest directly in the U.S. Ko criticized DPP leaders for blaming external factors instead of taking responsibility and advised them to move past internal divisions to avoid backlash from the public, akin to the impeachment faced by South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol.

#### [Lin Renbin's Viewpoint: Nuclear Power Extension is Unnecessary and Unfeasible](https://www.storm.mg/article/5350376) `È¢®ÂÇ≥Â™í`

Recently, legislator Ge Ru-jun, chair of the Education and Culture Committee of the Legislative Yuan, held hearings on several versions of the "Nuclear Reactor Facility Regulation Amendment Bill," proposed by opposition party members. This bill aims to extend the operation licenses of aging nuclear power plants beyond the current 40-year limit and allow for lengthy extension applications. However, due to differing positions among legislators, consensus has not been reached. The bill has been set aside for further negotiation.

The author argues that amending the laws to allow older nuclear plants to operate longer is unnecessary and impractical. Following the shutdown of nuclear power plants, Taiwan's reliance on nuclear energy has diminished significantly, with current data showing it accounting for only a small fraction of the energy supply. The author emphasizes that the transition to alternative energy sources can ensure energy security without nuclear power.

Concerns about energy independence and safety, as well as the unresolved issue of nuclear waste disposal, further complicate the rationale for extending the operation of aging nuclear plants. The author concludes that even if the amendment passes, ensuring safety and maintaining public consensus is crucial before any operational extensions can take place.

He previously announced "reciprocal tariffs," exempting semiconductors from the 32% tariff imposed on Taiwan, alleviating concerns for both the public and industry. However, he mentioned that pharmaceuticals, which were also exempt, will soon be reviewed for tariff implementation. The specific rates for these products are unclear, but Trump previously mentioned a starting rate of at least 25% for semiconductors.

In response to Trump's tariff announcement, Taiwan's government held a press conference, where spokesman Ge Ru-jun humorously remarked, "I might faint."

The Executive Yuan expressed that Trump's tariff policy does not accurately reflect Taiwan-US trade realities and is unfair to Taiwan, citing three main points of unreasonableness:

1. The calculation and scientific basis of the tariffs do not represent the complementary nature of Taiwan-US trade.
2. Taiwan's significant export increase to the US is a contribution to the US economy and security, yet it faces high tariffs.
3. The US's concerns about illegal transshipment do not apply to Taiwan, which has actively implemented measures against such activities.

Critics like Ge Ru-jun find this situation overwhelming.

Before the United States announced a 32% counterpart tariff on Taiwan, Premier Su Tseng-chang assured the public on Facebook that "the risks are controllable and the government is prepared," urging everyone to "sleep peacefully." However, just hours later, the hefty tariffs were officially implemented. Kuomintang lawmaker Ko Julu criticized Su, suggesting his Facebook post was akin to an April Fool's Day joke, highlighting the ruling party's lack of warning and preparation for this significant economic crisis.

Ko pointed out that the U.S. tariffs were not unfounded, as Taiwan's high tariffs on American imports had been a concern, particularly in the automotive industry. He lamented that the government ignored past proposals to lower tariffs, which could have provided room for negotiation and potentially avoided the current situation. He contrasted Taiwan's approach with Canada and Mexico, which negotiated effectively to avoid tariffs.

Ko warned that the tariff impact would extend beyond trade, affecting stock markets and consumer confidence. He criticized the ruling party for underestimating the situation while being oblivious to ongoing U.S. negotiations. Other party members echoed these sentiments, stressing the need for the government to provide clear explanations and solutions regarding the economic crisis and negotiate effectively to protect Taiwan‚Äôs industries from further losses. They urged for immediate action instead of passive responses to safeguard national competitiveness.

Legislator Ge Rujun stated that the Director of the American Institute in Taiwan, Eric Chien, has made it clear that energy shortages are a significant factor behind TSMC's decision to set up plants overseas. The Kuomintang (KMT) party has repeatedly expressed concerns about energy security. During past visits to Washington, many U.S. officials and legislators have raised these concerns. Eric Chien even mentioned that the U.S. can provide nuclear energy assistance; thus, Taiwan should no longer hesitate in exploring diverse energy options and shifting from a "non-nuclear" to a "carbon-free" policy.

Ge emphasized that the AIT has clearly indicated a willingness to collaborate with Taiwan on nuclear energy. However, DPP legislator Wu Sih Yao responded ideologically, stating that "nuclear is not the only option," similar to President Lai Ching-te's statement that there is "no pressure from the U.S." regarding TSMC's overseas move. This indicates a disconnect with reality. Ge further criticized the DPP for attempting to manipulate energy issues through specific groups to launch a ‚Äúmass recall‚Äù campaign, which they strongly oppose. National energy policy should be based on rational discussion and pragmatic decisions, not used as a political tool.

Ge revealed that the KMT would adapt to global trends by embracing the return of nuclear energy, such as advanced nuclear technologies like Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), to address U.S. concerns regarding Taiwan's energy security, thus positively accepting the challenge of rational energy transition.

Regarding the review timeline, Ge stated that the focus would be on public needs and economic development, prioritizing issues that concern industries and the public while maintaining communication with all sectors to ensure greater safety and security in energy policy, aligning with the U.S. perspective.

Recently, engineer and financial influencer Ge Ru-jun sparked controversy by revealing his help in writing a learning history for his niece, citing family resource advantages. This drew a response from Deputy Minister of Education Yeh Ping-cheng, who noted that "helping children cheat is not education."

On the 4th, Ge organized a press conference with student representatives, referencing a survey by the Child Welfare League, which revealed that 64.7% of students faced stress, primarily from schoolwork. The discussion intensified with allegations of parents hiring others to craft their children's learning histories. Ge pointed out that the rising market for paid services in this area contradicts the Ministry's claims.

He emphasized that the reliance on traditional grading in the age of AI requires re-evaluation of educational methods. Ge advocated for advancing his party's priority legislation, the "Artificial Intelligence Basic Law," which focuses on "digital equity" to alleviate students' academic burdens and mitigate digital divides across Taiwan.

He reiterated the need for better communication with U.S. leadership to ensure regional peace.

O'Kane warned that if Taiwan endured a conflict lasting three years, U.S. demands could favor American economic interests at the expense of Taiwan, drawing parallels to what might happen with U.S. mediation in a hypothetical Taiwan-China conflict.

The recent launch of China's large AI language model, DeepSeek-R1, has disrupted the global AI industry and raised concerns among governments and investors about data security issues. In response, Kuomintang legislator Lai Shih-Pao proposed today (17th) that the Executive Yuan should establish a platform to enhance domestic computing power to support the development of local AI language models. He is also working on a bill to promote data development and application, aiming to increase the sources of data for model training.

Lai Shih-Pao held a seminar titled "The Rise of DeepSeek: How Should Our Country Rescue AI Development Dilemma" at the Legislative Yuan, inviting prominent figures such as former Central Broadcasting Corporation Chairman Chao Shao-Kang and Taipei City Government Information Bureau Director Zhao Shi-long for discussion.

Lai pointed out that President Lai Ching-te has emphasized the need for sovereign AI development, stating that "AI represents national power." However, according to the global AI index, Taiwan ranks only 21st, lagging behind Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong, and last among the "Four Asian Tigers," indicating significant room for improvement.

Together with fellow Kuomintang legislator Ju-Chun KO, Lai has introduced a draft for an "AI Basic Law" and completed its first reading. He is also promoting a new bill to enhance local AI model training data sources.

Additionally, he highlighted that a solid foundation for AI development is computing power. Currently, Taiwan ranks 11th globally in supercomputing performance, and both academia and industry have reported insufficient domestic computing power at high costs. Therefore, he urged the Executive Yuan to establish a "Taiwan Supercomputing Platform" that combines resources from government, industry, and academia to improve AI computing efficiency.

Lai criticized the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) and the Ministry of Digital Affairs for what he perceives as a disregard for legislative proceedings, noting that their representatives withdrew from attending the seminar at the last minute, citing that the topic was not mature enough. He expressed strong protest against this decision and suggested that the high-profile attendance of Chao Shao-Kang may have influenced their decision to pull out.

The National Communications Commission (NCC) in Taiwan proposed a fee of 750 TWD for the review of specific electronic products, which sparked controversy and was subsequently postponed. KMT legislator Lin Pei-hsiung led a coordination meeting with NCC representatives, during which fellow legislators Ju-Chun KO and Liao Hsien-hsiang attended. They collectively agreed to delay the fee collection and suggested reverting to the old system.

NCC responded that it would reconsider the review fee related to the import of personal-use second-level telecommunications equipment and would pause the collection until a suitable adjustment is made according to applicable regulations. Lin and others emphasized that this fee should not be collected until a new NCC committee is established and called for a complete review of the fee mechanism.

They argued that the rationale for the fee, citing increased administrative costs due to more review cases, was unconvincing, as public service employee salaries are funded by public money and would not change with the fee collection. Ju-Chun KO highlighted that government review-related expenses should be managed through budget allocations rather than imposing unreasonable fees on the public.

Lin proposed that, instead of charging consumers, NCC should seek funds to introduce automation to enhance review efficiency. The NCC clarified that not all imported 3C products require paid reviews; only a random 5% are inspected unless voluntarily declared by the consumer.

Lin affirmed that he would continue to monitor the NCC in the legislature to ensure the policies do not exploit the public through unjust administrative fees, urging NCC to expedite a comprehensive review of the fee system based on public feedback.

Previously, review fees followed a tiered system, but the NCC plans to apply a blanket fee of 750 NT dollars, representing a 25% increase without adequate public discussion or policy assessment.

The author points out that the DPP government prioritizes political interests over practical needs, referencing past mismanagement in financial policies and energy subsidies. Although there is a temporary halt to this fee proposal thanks to KMT legislator Ju-Chun KO's efforts, the article asserts that the underlying budget issues need proper address through lawful supplementary budgets rather than increased administrative fees.

The overall emphasis is on the need for rational and transparent fiscal policies that align with the principles of social equity, urging ongoing legislative oversight to protect public interests and ensure economic stability in Taiwan.

On February 5, the National Communications Commission (NCC) announced a review fee of 750 NT dollars for Bluetooth devices, sparking outrage online and criticism from Kuomintang lawmakers. They accused NCC of imposing a de facto tax, hindering the import of affordable Chinese goods, and benefiting large corporations.

The fee was originally proposed due to an increase in the number of personal wireless devices being imported online, with NCC citing the need to maintain radio order and prevent interference with critical communications. Items subject to the review fee include personal Bluetooth devices purchased online and imported through mail. Critics argued that this move would serve to protect local businesses against cheaper foreign products.

This move has sparked outrage among netizens, who criticize it as a money grab disguised as a review fee. Kuomintang legislator Hsu Chiao-hsin expressed strong disapproval of the NCC, calling it a "bad agency" that lies and extorts money.

She argued that this substantial fee for items like a mouse is outrageous and that legislative oversight is essential to ensure the government accountability and budgeting improvements.

Ju-Chun KO highlighted additional items affected, such as laptops, tablets, drones, and VR goggles, which are widely used by the public. His office has received numerous inquiries about this issue, and when contacting the NCC, they confirmed that revisions to the telecommunication fee standards were indeed being implemented.

Recently, the emergence of a mainland AI system has shocked various sectors, prompting Taiwan's Premier Su Tseng-chang to order a complete ban on its use by public agencies. Nationalist Party legislator Ju-Chun Ko (ËëõÂ¶ÇÈàû) highlighted four months ago that Taiwan needs to develop its own independent AI technology to safeguard national sovereignty; otherwise, the concept of a sovereign AI would remain just an illusion.

With the rapid rise of DeepSeek, an open-weight model comparable in performance to OpenAI's offerings and licensed under MIT, the call for urgent action becomes even more pressing. Yesterday, at a press conference, the Executive Yuan expressed concerns about AI computing power and sovereignty but then mandated public agencies to refrain from using DeepSeek while requiring universities and research institutions to seek approval for its use.

Ko pointed out persistent issues surrounding Taiwan's sovereignty in AI, including a lack of data, talent, and computing resources. He noted that Taiwan's own large language model, TAIDE, has faced resource shortages, with its latest version still unreleased while DeepSeek's capabilities have expanded considerably.

Ko emphasized the need for prompt strategic development for Taiwan's sovereign AI or risk falling behind. Despite concerns some may have about DeepSeek‚Äôs potential Chinese influence, its MIT licensing allows for the potential restructuring of its values. He reiterated a set of recommendations made to the Executive Yuan, including establishing a data repository with Taiwanese elements and clarifying budget allocations to support the development of sovereign AI.

Ko criticized the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for obstructing progress, asserting that the Nationalist Party would not allow such situations to persist and is committed to pushing forward legislation that benefits citizens and advances technological development. The Nationalist Party currently has various proposals for AI legislation under consideration, reflecting a collective effort to support Taiwan's enhanced participation in the global digital economy.

Research indicates that TikTok may influence political narratives among Taiwanese users, leading to lower satisfaction with democracy and an increased acceptance of Chinese viewpoints.

K.M.T. legislator Ju-Chun Ko emphasizes the importance of free speech and believes that monitoring TikTok is more prudent than an outright ban, highlighting that such a decision should be based on public consensus and further discussion. Meanwhile, calls for regulation from the New Power Party demonstrate a division of opinion on how best to manage the app's influence, with both parties agreeing on a cautious approach.

On September 9th, the Legislative Yuan's Education and Culture Committee reviewed the draft bill for the "Preservation of Injustice Sites." Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed significant disagreement over the name of the bill and the timeframe it covers. There was no consensus on whether to use the term "Injustice Sites" or change it to "Memorial Sites for Human Rights Events," nor whether the timeframe should be limited to the authoritarian rule era or include the Qing Dynasty and Japanese colonial period.

Several Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers argued that the definition of "Injustice Sites" should not only pertain to the era after the establishment of the Republic of China, pointing out historical injustices against Indigenous peoples under various rulers. Other lawmakers emphasized the broader implications of injustice, highlighting incidents during the Japanese occupation.

Discussions on the bill's title led KMT lawmaker Ko Chih-en to suggest changing "Injustice Sites" to "Memorial Sites for Human Rights Events," advocating for reconciliation rather than division. Lawmaker Keh Ju-chun questioned whether advocacy for martial law could be labeled as "unjust speech."

As opinions remained divided and consensus was not reached, the committee decided to retain the bill's name and reserve the related articles for further discussion at a later date.

On January 9, the Legislative Yuan's Education and Culture Committee discussed the draft of the "Unjust Site Preservation Act." Opposition legislator Ju-Chun KO (ËëõÂ¶ÇÈàû) questioned whether the definition of "unjust" could be applied universally across different historical periods. He highlighted the proposal by Deputy Minister of Culture Lee Yuan, known for his pen name Xiaoye, in response to criticism about recent comments supporting martial law by a DPP member. Lee emphasized the advancement of democracy in South Korea, asserting that any call for martial law today would be ineffective and reflect a regression rather than progress.

Lee responded to KO‚Äôs interjection about the efficacy of martial law by arguing that the real issue lies in the collective sentiment of the population, which overwhelmingly opposes such measures. He stressed the need for a thoughtful reflection on history without instigating hatred or conflicts. KO advocated for broader discussions on the issue through public hearings to achieve a comprehensive understanding.

On January 9th, the Legislative Yuan's Education and Culture Committee reviewed the draft of the "Unjust Site Preservation Act." Independent legislator Kao Chin Su-mei and Kuomintang legislator Cheng Tien-tsai proposed to expand the definition of unjust sites to include human rights incidents from the Qing dynasty onward, and during the Japanese colonial period, sparking a debate. Culture Minister Lee Yuan explained that the bill is based on the transitional justice framework and does not include earlier eras to avoid perceptions that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party is unfairly targeting the Kuomintang.

Blue camp legislator Ju-Chun KO criticized the limited scope, stating that human rights violations occur continuously and emphasizing that current events should be prioritized in discussions about the law. Minister Lee reiterated the importance of self-reflection by the government for addressing past injustices and acknowledged the significance of unjust sites for many individuals. Ultimately, the committee reached no consensus, deciding to hold further public hearings on the matter. Additionally, pro-Taiwanese groups condemned the opposition's proposals as attempts to dilute the understanding of state violence.

The Legislative Yuan's Education and Culture Committee is reviewing the "Unjust Site Preservation Act Draft," which aims to systematize the preservation and maintenance of unjust historical sites. Discrepancies in foundational definitions and the precise terminology used, such as "unjust site," have led to differing opinions among legislators, resulting in the retention of the provisions for further discussion. Notably, Kuomintang (KMT) legislator Ju-Chun Ko advocates for a more neutral term, "human rights historical field." Meanwhile, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators argue that "unjust site" is internationally recognized terminology.

The committee also discussed the competency of the Ministry of Culture as the sole authority for managing these sites, with calls for more collaborative efforts among different governmental bodies. Due to a lack of consensus on various provisions, the committee decided to continue the review in subsequent meetings.

On September 9, the Legislative Yuan's Education and Culture Committee reviewed the "Unjust Site Preservation Bill." Due to significant disagreements among legislators regarding its name, definitions, and historical boundaries, consensus was not reached, and most articles were left for further deliberation, necessitating additional public hearings.

Nationalist Party legislator Ju-Chun KO (ËëõÂ¶ÇÈàû) repeatedly singled out Culture Minister Li Yuan for questions, particularly regarding whether supporting martial law constitutes unjust speech. Li replied that regressing to a previous era would be tragic and referenced a recent proclamation of martial law in South Korea that could not be enacted due to the nation's democratic progress. He emphasized that such regressive statements lack significance, as the public overwhelmingly opposes martial law. Ju-Chun KO did not respond to Li Yuan's comments and promptly exited the meeting.

President Lai Ching-te has appointed Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu to lead a delegation of legislators to the United States for the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on January 20. The delegation initially consisted of eight legislators, but an unexpected letter from the Legislative Yuan indicated the inclusion of Deputy Speaker Chiang Chi-chen, raising operational concerns for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. To maintain respect for U.S.-Taiwan relations and administrative efficiency, the ministry suggested adjusting the composition of the delegation among the existing members.

The delegation includes members from various parties, such as KMT legislators Li Yan-xiu, Ko Chih-en, and Ju-Chun KO; DPP legislators Wang Ding-yu, Chen Kuan-ting, and Kuo Yu-ching; and PFP legislator Chen Chao-tzu. In light of the approaching absence of both the Legislative Speaker and the Deputy Speaker during critical sessions, there are pressures to expedite the review of the central government's budget.

Legislative procedures may be impacted if both Han and Chiang attend the inauguration, with concerns that this could lead to a DPP representative presiding over sessions instead. Amid budget discussions, there is ongoing pressure to conclude before the legislative session recesses on January 21, as the approval process remains behind schedule. KMT's caucus leader has assured the completion of the budget review despite challenges presented by the DPP.

The Legislative Education and Culture Committee criticized the Ministry of Education for not adequately planning and requested that future policies involving agriculture be reported to the committee beforehand.

Several legislators, including DPP members and KMT member Ke Chih-en, expressed concern over the lack of swimming instruction, noting its potential link to drowning rates.

The Ministry has proposed adding 3.5 billion TWD to this fund for the next year. Initially, a proposal was made to freeze 50 million TWD, but after communication between the Education Minister and committee members, it was decided to freeze 10 million TWD.

The ongoing trend of declining birth rates is impacting private schools, particularly at the high school and vocational levels, leading many to face closure. Lawmakers from various parties, including Gu Ru-jun (Ju-Chun KO), expressed concern over this issue. The Education Minister emphasized the importance of sustaining the operation of schools and ensuring provisions for teachers and students if closure is inevitable.

After the implementation of the 108 curriculum program, high school students are required to create a learning portfolio. However, several legislators pointed out today that the submission rate of portfolios by economically disadvantaged students is significantly lower than that of their peers, indicating that this policy disadvantages weaker students. In response, the Ministry of Education announced that next year, it will provide every high school student with a manual titled "Collaborative Learning Portfolio ‚Äì Suggestions for Presenting Learning Achievements" to assist them in creating their portfolios.

During the Legislative Yuan's review of the Ministry's budget, KMT lawmaker Wan Mei-Ling cited a report from student group EdYouth, revealing that 55.41% of students believe portfolio creation does not aid career exploration, and 56.73% think it is merely a tool for further education, turning the portfolio into a competitive "arms race" rather than achieving its intended goals.

DPP lawmaker Lin Yi-Chin noted the increasing submission rates of learning achievements, with non-submission rates rising from 18.31% in the first cohort to 30.17% in the third for learning achievements, and even higher rates for economically disadvantaged students.

KMT lawmaker Ju-Chun Ko raised concerns over the commercialization of portfolios, with examples of templates priced at NT$2000 and packages offering comprehensive college preparation for nearly NT$10,000. This commercialization severely affects the opportunity for economically disadvantaged students to access higher education.

Additionally, KMT lawmaker Luo Ting-Wei mentioned complaints from students from remote islands who incur significant costs for attending additional classes on the main island to enrich their portfolios, highlighting the need for improvements in this system.

The Ministry of Education plans to distribute one manual per high school student next year as a guideline for portfolio creation. The Ministry's international director, Peng Fu-Yuan, stated that the Deputy Minister, Yeh Ping-Cheng, often goes to various cities on weekends to communicate the correct approach to portfolio creation. Furthermore, the Ministry has produced three instructional videos to assist students.

During the Legislative Yuan discussions, KMT legislator Hung Meng-kai proposed freezing NT$50 million of the exit fund budget, with support from several representatives including Ko Ju-Chun (ËëõÂ¶ÇÈàû). Concerns were raised regarding Taiwan's declining birthrate and the increasing number of private schools facing closure.

According to a report from the International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC2), the shortage of cybersecurity professionals is pronounced, with Taiwan facing a workforce deficit of 24.1%. In response, the National Cybersecurity Agency has introduced measures to attract and retain talent, including special bonuses approved by the Executive Yuan.

KO criticized the government‚Äôs bureaucratic constraints which hinder the recruitment of digital specialists, particularly in AI, where entry-level positions in the U.S. can offer salaries as high as 4.5 million NTD per year. He suggested that if the government is serious about integrating AI into cabinet functions and sees cybersecurity as a national security issue, it should prioritize better compensation for cybersecurity personnel.

In terms of talent development, another legislator, Lin Chuyin, pointed out that only 11% of students enter the cybersecurity industry each year, highlighting a disconnect between education and practical application. Recent changes by the Ministry of Education have also led to a decrease in enrollment in top national universities' electrical engineering and computer science departments, raising concerns about supply and demand in the future workforce.

KMT legislator Ju-Chun KO pointed out alarming statistics, noting that the highest single-day fraud amount reached NT$550 million, and emphasized the need for government collaboration with the private sector to combat this issue effectively. The legislators urged for innovative thinking across legal, technological, and financial sectors to tackle the problem.

The issue has escalated, with instances reported of deepfake technology being used to create non-consensual pornography, prompting discussions in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan involving security agencies like the National Security Bureau and the Ministry of Justice.

Amid rising concerns, law enforcement has investigated several deepfake cases, with implications for the upcoming presidential elections. However, challenges remain in addressing impersonations and managing the impact on verified social media accounts. Legislator Ju-Chun Ko raised concerns regarding miscommunication between government agencies and platforms like Meta, which led to unwarranted account suspensions based on erroneous blacklists.

Despite efforts to establish communication channels with international platforms, officials struggle with accountability given the positions of these companies overseas.

Recent discussions led by lawmakers Ju-Chun KO and Chang Ya-Lin emphasized the rising issues of online fraud and privacy violations in schools. They called for increased educational resources to enhance digital citizenship capabilities among students.

They called for the enhancement of digital citizenship education to address various digital risks faced by today's youth.

Wang Hsi highlighted that students are currently encountering "dual risks": the first being scams and privacy breaches, and the second being addiction to social media and anxiety. While today's youth are often seen as "digital natives" due to their continuous exposure to the internet and digital tools, it does not automatically grant them digital citizenship skills. Many students, despite being skilled in using smartphones, lack awareness of online interactions and often resort to informal channels like LINE for school reports, demonstrating a need for improved digital literacy. Wang emphasized that these frontline experiences underscore the necessity of the "Next-Generation Digital Citizenship Literacy" book in Taiwan's society.

On the 15th, several popular Taiwanese internet celebrities' Facebook fan pages, including well-known host Wu Danru, were suddenly blocked, preventing users from searching for related pages. KMT legislator Wang Hongwei raised questions about the incident in the Legislative Yuan on the 18th. Lin Hsin-hsiung, Deputy Director of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, clarified that they had provided a genuine "whitelist" but issues arose during Facebook's internal screening process.

On the same day, many internet personalities received notices from Facebook stating, "Taiwan users will not see your content," citing legal requirements that necessitated limiting access to their content. KMT legislator Ju-Chun Ko questioned why the Digital Development Department had begun collecting "genuine fan page" whitelists since June, only to mistakenly include even the official Stock Exchange fan page in the takedown.

Deputy Minister Lin Yi-ching noted that it was unclear whether Facebook had received requests to block these pages from other parties. According to Lin Hsin-hsiung, this was not an issue from their side, but rather a problem with Facebook's internal filtering mechanism. Following the investigation, it was confirmed that the blocked pages were not part of a blacklist sent by the Criminal Investigation Bureau, and they communicated with Facebook, leading to the restoration of the affected websites that same evening.

Recently, several influencer pages were unexpectedly taken down by Facebook, affecting even the Stock Exchange. The Ministry of Digital Affairs clarified that they did not post or notify Facebook to take these pages down. On the 18th, Deputy Chief Lin Yi-Ching revealed that a communication issue occurred with Facebook‚Äôs overseas unit, leading to misunderstandings about the Ministry's involvement.

Lin explained that the National Police Agency reported fraudulent websites, but it was not a criminal bureau issue, rather an internal filtering problem at Facebook. He stressed that the Ministry had not requested Facebook to take down any pages and was coordinating with Facebook to address public concerns.

The Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee invited various agencies, including the National Security Bureau and the Ministry of Digital Affairs, to report on the implications of AI technology in cybersecurity and misinformation, and conducted a Q&A session.

Regarding the emerging issues from digital platforms, Lin mentioned past attempts to address related matters with Facebook‚Äôs legal team, but due to limited personnel in Taiwan, they sought assistance from the Singapore office and communicated with visiting U.S. personnel for ongoing pressure. He also agreed with lawmakers, including Ju-Chun KO, that penalties will be enforced after the anti-fraud law is implemented, and requested a weekly update of the whitelist with relevant information excluding privacy details.

On addressing AI risks, lawmakers inquired about strengthening measures, to which Lin emphasized ongoing inter-agency communication, although some matters involve national security and won't be disclosed publicly.

They reported that most online fraud cases originate from Meta platforms, urging the government to implement source management.

Legislator Ko Ju-Chun inquired about Facebook's recent removal of authentic celebrity pages, which the platform claimed was at the request of Taiwan‚Äôs Criminal Investigation Bureau.

On the night of November 15, Ju-Chun KO (ËëõÂ¶ÇÈàû), a technology legislator in Taiwan, mentioned a significant incident where various financial fan pages and celebrity accounts on Facebook were collectively blocked. This was suspected to be due to a misunderstanding where a blacklist was mistakenly applied instead of a whitelist created by the Digital Development Ministry aimed at combatting scams. Following the restoration of many accounts, KO posted on Facebook thanking Meta (Facebook's parent company), which drew criticism from netizens questioning his logic for praising the very company that caused the issue. Many criticized his approach for blaming the government while seemingly exonerating Meta for the mishap. KO had initially expressed concerns about the incident, highlighting the ministry‚Äôs need for accountability. The ministry denied requesting Facebook to block the accounts and emphasized they were working to resolve the situation after receiving complaints from the public.

On October 15, multiple financial influencers‚Äô Facebook pages, as well as the official account of the Taiwan Stock Exchange, were unexpectedly taken down, preventing users from accessing these pages. This incident also affected well-known figures like host Wu Danru. Although Facebook usually removes accounts for impersonation or fraud, this time, legitimate pages were blocked, sparking public outcry.

The Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) stated that it worked overnight to resolve the issue, and most pages were restored by the following morning. Since June, MODA has developed a "Fraud Reporting and Inquiry Platform," where many celebrities are on a whitelist to quickly report impersonation accounts. Surprisingly, on the evening of October 15, numerous legitimate financial influencers' pages were restricted simultaneously without malicious reports against them.

Affected pages received notifications saying their content is not visible to Taiwanese users due to legal requirements. The page "ÁÆóÂà©ÊïôÂÆò‚îÄÊ•äÁ¶ÆËªí" also reported being blocked while actual impersonating accounts remained active.

LIN Yi-jing, the MODA deputy minister, acknowledged receiving reports and taking immediate action, but he was unclear about whether other entities requested Facebook to block the pages. He encouraged influencers to express their concerns but urged them to avoid misdirected criticism.

However, KMT legislator Ju-Chun KO criticized MODA's response, noting the lack of communication and accountability, expressing disappointment in how the ministry handled the crisis amid significant public interest and impact on rights.

On the evening of the 15th, several legitimate financial Facebook pages, including those run by Wu Dan-ru and "Gu Yan," were taken down unexpectedly. One of the affected pages, "Gu Ren Ah Xun," criticized the Digital Development Department (DDD) for being ineffective against fraudsters. Legislative Yuan member Ju-Chun KO (ËëõÂ¶ÇÈàû) questioned the DDD's practices, suggesting they mistakenly switched their whitelist of legitimate pages to a blacklist, leading to the accidental removal of these pages.

Since June, the DDD had been collecting information to create a whitelist for financial influencers to protect verified pages, stating they had established a fast removal mechanism with Meta. However, the sudden removal of several legitimate pages raised questions about the operational transparency of these procedures.

Ju-Chun KO called for the government to publicly disclose the criteria and processes involved in these removals to gain public trust and prevent future incidents. Another legislator, Wang Hong-wei, criticized the DDD for spending over NT$20 billion without effectively tackling fraudulent websites while inadvertently removing legitimate ones.

In response, the DDD claimed it had not communicated with Facebook regarding the whitelist and would continue to coordinate with Meta to address the issue and prevent its recurrence.

On the evening of the 15th, multiple Facebook pages focused on finance and stock topics were suddenly blocked and disappeared without warning. KMT legislator Ju-Chun KO criticized that the Ministry of Digital Affairs had been collecting a whitelist of legitimate pages since June. He questioned whether a mix-up between black and white lists had occurred, as even the official stock exchange page was removed.

Ju-Chun KO noted that around 11 PM, many finance influencers reported on Facebook that their pages had been taken down, including the well-known influencer "ËÇ°Áôå," who appealed on Instagram for help from the Ministry and Meta. He suggested that the simultaneous removal of well-known pages indicated a systemic issue within the ministry. During the time these legitimate pages were unavailable, the public might mistakenly join counterfeit pages and become victims of scams.

Ju-Chun KO criticized the Ministry's previous anti-fraud app, which was taken down just 15 days after launch, and now the sudden removal of the whitelist. He stated, "This is not the sense of security that taxpayers deserve." He emphasized support for government anti-fraud efforts but warned that if they couldn't demonstrate effective results, budget reviews would be strict.

In response, the Ministry of Digital Affairs issued a statement on the 16th clarifying that they had not requested Facebook to take down any pages. After receiving complaints from the public, they worked overnight to coordinate with Facebook, and most of the pages were restored by the morning.

Ju-Chun KO, a member of the Kuomintang, commented on the recent incident where multiple popular Facebook pages, including those of several financial influencers, were mistakenly taken down. After contacting various parties, most pages were restored the following morning. KO highlighted serious shortcomings in the Ministry of Digital Technology regarding cybersecurity and fraud prevention. He proposed four key points for improvement:

1. Investigate potential misclassification of "whitelisted" accounts as "blacklisted."
2. Clarify the legal basis for the takedowns, ensuring no misinformation from fraudsters.
3. Assess vulnerabilities in the "rapid takedown" mechanism and ensure transparency in operations.
4. Promote transparency by revealing operational processes and historical records related to the takedown procedures.

Ju-Chun KO, a current legislator specializing in technology information, pointed out in an interview with NOWnews that the simultaneous removal of these pages suggests it was unlikely to be a result of malicious reporting. He speculated that it may relate to a human error tied to the Digital Development Department's (DigiDev) anti-fraud whitelist. KO stated this incident could be considered a significant cybersecurity event and expressed frustration over the lack of prompt response from DigiDev. Despite the brief downtime of about two to three hours, the impact on influential figures induced considerable public panic, prompting concerns over potential scams as legitimate financial influencers were sidelined. DigiDev later clarified that they did not request Facebook to take down the pages but worked overnight to resolve the issue, which most pages have since regained access to.

He criticized the ministry for its lack of effective measures against fraud, stating that the sudden removal of credible pages could mislead the public into following fake ones.

Ju-Chun KO recounted that since June, there were discussions about creating a white list to protect verified financial pages, but the recent incident indicated a systemic issue within the ministry's reporting procedures. He emphasized the need for a clear explanation of what went wrong, especially considering the timing of the removals was close to the ministry's fraud prevention initiatives. KO criticized the ministry for past failures, including the quick removal of their anti-fraud app, and asserted that any continued inadequacies in tackling fraud would lead to increased scrutiny on the ministry's budget.

Legislator Ju-Chun KO expressed concerns in an interview, stating that the Digital Development Department should promptly clarify the situation to the public.

Despite initial speculations blaming Meta, Ju-Chun KO pointed out that the Digital Development Department needs to investigate the incident alongside relevant firms. Two main concerns were raised: the recent rapid deployment and subsequent removal of a "Fraud Reporting Query Network," and the paradox where individuals on a "VIP whitelist" intended for fraud protection were also removed. The incident raises doubts about potential human error or system glitches in the digital mechanisms linked with Meta.

As of now, both the Digital Development Department and Meta have not issued any responses, leading to further speculation about the connection between the two events.

Following the incident, Ju-Chun KO updated that Meta has successfully restored all affected pages after communication efforts.

In early September, the Ministry of Education held a press conference for the "Taiwan University Artificial Intelligence Curriculum Alliance" (TAICA), inviting notable universities like National Taiwan University and National Tsing Hua University to offer AI-related courses this semester. However, student enrollment has been disappointing, primarily due to courses being taught in English and insufficient promotion.

#### [Who Would Benefit TSMC and the AI Industry: Trump or Kamala Harris? Ju-Chun KO's Latest Analysis](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20241106002299-260407) `‰∏≠ÊôÇÊñ∞ËÅûÁ∂≤`

The U.S. presidential election began voting on the 5th, with potential implications for Taiwan's AI industry and TSMC based on whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump wins. Ju-Chun KO, a KMT legislator with expertise in AI, believes that both candidates acknowledge the importance of Taiwanese chips and TSMC to the U.S. Regardless of who wins, he expects new collaborations, albeit with different strategies and paces.

In a recent interview, KO highlighted TSMC as a symbol of Taiwan's technological prowess. While Trump has repeatedly mentioned TSMC, KO posits that this may be aimed more at voters and other countries rather than attempting to pressure Taiwan. He noted that there is a consensus in the U.S. about the significance of Taiwanese chips and TSMC, which will likely lead to more countries seeking partnerships with TSMC.

Regarding the impact on Taiwan's AI industry, KO suggests that Trump's past presidency favored foreign companies setting up in the U.S. with supportive subsidies and tariff adjustments aimed at boosting American competitiveness. The future use of tariffs by Trump as a means of addressing chip or AI issues remains uncertain, but he has historically encouraged foreign investment in the U.S., which motivated TSMC's initial decision to establish operations in America.

As for Harris and the Democratic stance on AI and technology, KO finds them comparatively conservative, likely imposing more restrictions on foreign companies' operations in the U.S. This could prompt Taiwanese chip manufacturers to relocate, though the processes and subsidies may be more stringent.

In summary, KO emphasizes that both candidates would support Taiwan and its technological development. Trump may exhibit a more open approach with significant tech industry backing, while Harris is supportive yet more cautious. Both recognize Taiwan's critical position on the global stage.

Ju-Chun KO, a legislator from the Kuomintang, is actively promoting AI technology and innovation, emphasizing the integration of technology with democratic governance. Recently, he participated in the "A New World" event, supported by the World company, co-founded and chaired by Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI.

KO was the only officially invited participant from the Asia-Pacific region. He represented the Legislative Yuan of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the Emerging Technology Exchange Association (ETEA) at the event in San Francisco, where he announced the experimental application of World ID in Taiwan, launching the TAIVote platform. This platform will utilize World ID technology for secure, anonymous voting trials, marking a significant application of advanced technology in democratic decision-making in Taiwan.

KO noted that Taiwan is exploring the establishment of an "AI Basic Law," with TAIVote's first testing phase addressing critical questions like copyright protection and AI development restrictions. Participants verified through World ID will provide insights for future policy-making. This initiative aims to enhance Taiwan's role in global AI governance and position it as a leader in integrating advanced technology with democratic processes.

The Taiwan Legislative Yuan faced a deadlock over the general budget proposal on Tuesday, as it was not included in the agenda for the session. Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) members queued to propose the budget's inclusion but were opposed by the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People‚Äôs Party, ultimately leading to a vote of 49 in favor and 58 against. Key DPP figures, including party whip Ker Chien-Ming and legislator Yang Yao, did not cast votes.

In protest, DPP legislators rallied, criticizing the opposition for obstructing budget discussions. The deadlock was rooted in disputes over indigenous compensation legislation, with DPP only agreeing to raise the compensation from NT$30,000 to NT$40,000, while KMT and the People‚Äôs Party insisted on an increase to NT$60,000, arguing the law had been passed.

Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu announced that discussions would continue the following Monday, asking the Ministry of Finance for concrete solutions. Despite efforts by DPP members to add the budget proposal to the agenda at dawn on Wednesday, the absence of influential party members contributed to a failed vote, highlighting the ongoing divisions between the ruling and opposition parties. Legislator Ko Ju-Chun from the KMT also did not participate in the vote.

#### [University AI Program Enrollment Questioned: Yeh Ping-Chung Responds with Preparedness for Talent Shortage](https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/life/breakingnews/4832341) `Ëá™Áî±ÊôÇÂ†±`

The Ministry of Education in Taiwan, led by Vice Minister Yeh Ping-cheng, introduced the "Taiwan University AI Course Alliance" (TAICA) to provide AI courses for university students. There were concerns about low enrollment numbers; however, Yeh clarified that only a few schools had low attendance and emphasized that the initiative is not an immediate push for large numbers but a gradual approach to support future enrollment in AI courses.

In a legislative session attended by KMT legislator Ju-Chun KO and DPP legislator Chen Hsiu-bao, they raised questions about the program. Yeh stated that there is a consensus in the industry regarding the future demand for AI talent and that preparations are being made to ensure sufficient capacity for students wanting to take AI courses. Currently, around 2,527 students have enrolled, and as TAICA expands to nearly 50 universities in the next semester, more students will have the opportunity to learn about AI. Yeh acknowledged that private schools providing scholarships to encourage AI course enrollment is within their autonomy, as long as it does not detract from resources available to other students. The ministry aims to cultivate thousands of AI professionals over the next three years through this initiative.

Taiwan's AI program in universities has garnered attention, especially from legislators, as the actual enrollment figures are only about half of the 5,300 available spots. Ju-Chun KO (ËëõÂ¶ÇÈàû), a legislator from the Kuomintang, and Chen Hsiu-Pao from the Democratic Progressive Party raised concerns during a report from the Ministry of Education. The ministry clarified that there was no intention to increase enrollment numbers artificially.

To address the impending shortage of AI talent, 25 universities formed the Taiwan AI University Curriculum Alliance (TAICA), which launched its program in the 113 academic year. The educational deputy minister, Yeh Ping-Cheng, mentioned that the current enrollment of over 2,500 validates TAICA's capacity to handle student demand. Some private schools are offering significant incentives, like NT$10,000 for taking an AI course, to boost enrollment. Yeh stated that these incentives are a way to encourage students to meet challenges and that the ministry respects universities' autonomy as long as they do not detract from other resources.

Taiwan's AI program at universities is facing challenges, with only about 50% of the planned enrollment of 5,300 students participating in the first year. Deputy Minister of Education Yeh Ping-cheng stated that the focus was never on hitting enrollment numbers but rather on preparing for future AI talent shortages. He noted that issues have arisen in administrative support and course evaluations, and they aim to address these concerns going forward. Some private universities are incentivizing students to enroll in AI courses with substantial rewards, which has raised questions about appropriateness, but the Ministry respects their autonomous decision-making.

The article reports on a gathering in Keelung, where Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers expressed their support for Mayor Hsieh Kuo-liang amidst his ongoing recall vote.

In Keelung City, as the recall election for Mayor Hsieh Kuo-Liang approaches in two days, prominent figures from the Kuomintang party, including Chairman Zhu Lilun and legislative leader Fu Kun-Chi, have shown support for Hsieh. Even the Taiwan People's Party has joined the effort, urging citizens to vote "no" on the recall. Several KMT legislators have campaigned in the area, advocating for Hsieh and emphasizing the importance of democratic processes.

Legislators highlighted the need for public participation, warning that not voting is equivalent to supporting the recall. They argue that letting Hsieh continue is crucial for the well-being of the city, asserting it is not the right moment for political retribution through recalls. The consensus among opposition parties is to unite against the ruling party's dominance.

Focusing on the issues, they argue the recall lacks justification as the city government has made progress. As the election nears, both the KMT and the Taiwan People's Party are rallying their supporters to ensure a strong turnout to defeat the recall attempt, viewing this as a pivotal moment for local governance in Taiwan.

The Taiwanese semiconductor industry is capitalizing on the AI boom, with companies like TSMC leading globally in technological capabilities. To foster innovation and train research talent, the central government has planned to invest NT$300 billion in the "Innovative Taiwan" program from 2024 to 2033, pending Legislative Yuan approval. However, KMT legislator Ju-Chun Ko has raised concerns about the lack of clarity in how the funds will be allocated, describing the plan as a "blank check."

On September 9, National Science Council (NSC) Chair Wu Cheng-wen presented a report to the Legislative Yuan's Education and Culture Committee, where Ko criticized that the 36-page plan outlines a NT$1.33 trillion budget, equating to NT$3.6 billion per page, and points out the absence of annual budget execution plans and performance indicators (KPI, OKR).

The NSC responded that the plan is a proposal and does not include detailed KPIs. Wu clarified that the budget for 2025 is set at NT$18.3 billion, not NT$30 billion as suggested. The larger "Innovative Taiwan" plan would encompass budgets from various ministries, totaling NT$18.3 billion for 2025.

However, Ko found the budget proposals vague and inconsistent, demanding a restructured plan under legal guidelines for proper budget examination. Before the deadline, his office confirmed that the NSC had provided additional information for review.

The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Agriculture have launched the "Fresh Milk for Every Class" policy, but its hasty implementation has left teachers struggling. The National Teachers' Union held a press conference with several legislators from both parties, urging the government to reconsider the policy, suggesting instead to distribute "milk vouchers" rather than having schools implement the program directly.

The Union's president, Hou Jun-liang, criticized the policy for requiring students to drink milk immediately during and after class, which raises issues of product spoilage and the handling of unconsumed milk. He argued that schools are not suitable environments for such initiatives.

Legislator Ju-Chun KO from the Kuomintang noted the good intentions behind the policy but pointed out that the lack of planning has led to a situation where it feels like a loss for all. He emphasized the need for innovative approaches from the educational and agricultural departments.

Democratic Progressive Party legislator Chang Hong-lu expressed support for the initiative, highlighting its benefits for local dairy farmers but noted the communication issues between government departments that unfairly burden teachers.

People's Party legislator Wu Chun-cheng mentioned that the policy involves complex logistics like distribution and cold chains, indicating that the education system has become chaotic due to the lack of prior planning.

The Teachers' Union called for an immediate adjustment of the policy to promote the issuance of "milk vouchers," allowing students to exchange them at convenience stores, which would reduce the administrative burden on schools and ensure food safety for the children.

The "Áè≠Áè≠ÊúâÈÆÆ‰π≥" (Fresh Milk for Every Class) policy has received feedback from schools about increased administrative burdens. At a press conference held by the National Teachers' Union (ÂÖ®ÊïôÁ∏Ω), Chairman Hou Jun-liang questioned why the Ministry of Agriculture's policy must be executed by schools, suggesting it turns schools into a source of funding for agricultural policies. He proposed distributing "fresh milk vouchers" instead, which could ease the logistical strain on schools.

Legislator Ju-Chun Ko expressed concerns that the government should avoid turning the "win-win" policy into a "lose-lose" situation, highlighting issues with the cost of fresh milk and transportation, which has led some schools to prefer long-lasting milk. He urged the government to reevaluate the policy if problems arise, emphasizing the need for careful implementation.

Legislator Zhang Hong-lu noted that while providing fresh milk to students is a good initiative, the communication issues between the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Agriculture have burdened teachers with responsibilities that should not fall on them. Both legislators called for funds to be allocated adequately to support local dairy farmers while improving policy execution.

Today, the National Federation of Teachers' Unions held a press conference with legislators from various parties. NFU Chairman Hou Junliang expressed support for dairy farmers and calcium supplementation for students, but criticized the "Fresh Milk for Every Class" policy, stating it increases teachers' administrative burdens. He called on the government to utilize over 13,000 convenience stores nationwide, allowing students to exchange coupons for either fresh or long-life milk.

Hou indicated that before the policy began in August, the NFU warned government bodies about the potential strain on administrative work in schools. Teachers should focus on education, not endless administrative tasks. He emphasized the need for sustainable agricultural policies.

Various party legislators, including the Democratic Progressive Party's Guo Yuqing and Zhang Honglu, along with the Kuomintang's Ju-Chun Ko, attended the conference. Guo pointed out calcium deficiency in children ages 4 to 18 and praised the government's intentions with the policy, which also aims to support local dairy farmers. She suggested rebranding the initiative as a "Calcium Supplement Program" and mentioned that the Ministry of Education would make adjustments to lessen the administrative workload on schools.

In Taiwan, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Education have launched a program requiring elementary schools to provide milk to students, referred to as "Áè≠Áè≠ÂñùÈÆÆÂ•∂" (Every Class Drinks Fresh Milk). However, due to concerns over cold chain logistics and food safety, over 75% of schools opted for long-lasting milk, with many students having yet to receive any milk even after a month into the school year. Legislators, including Ju-Chun KO and others, criticized the policy as rushed and called for its immediate adjustment. The National Federation of Teachers' Unions held a press conference highlighting the administrative burden on schools and suggested issuing "milk vouchers" for students to redeem milk closer to their homes instead of forcing schools to handle the distribution. Legislative member Guo Yu-Ching stated that a motion has been introduced to require the ministries to review and refine the program within two months.

However, legislator Ju-Chun KO (ËëõÂ¶ÇÈàû) questioned why the number of enrolled students this semester is less than half of the expected, with only 2,500 out of 5,300 spots filled, and merely 1,500 cross-enrollment students. He suggested that promotional strategies might need adjustment and proposed investigating whether similar courses at individual schools are contributing to this enrollment gap. In response, Education Minister Cheng Ying-yao stated that the ministry must consider educational quality when increasing admission quotas and emphasized ongoing efforts to improve future enrollment, aiming for 5,000 students next semester.

The article discusses Taiwan's current challenges described as the "New Five Deficiencies," which include power shortages, talent deficiencies, lack of infrastructure, inability to resolve cross-strait tensions, and unwillingness from foreign partners to make concrete commitments. It highlights concerns stemming from geopolitical risks, specifically referencing billionaire investor Warren Buffett's remarks on selling Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) due to such risks.

As countries implement the "Taiwan+1" strategy, firms are seeking alternatives outside of Taiwan to mitigate geopolitical impacts, further exacerbating local issues such as low wages and hindering the industry's transformation. Legislative Member Ju-Chun Ko warns that while Taiwan excels in advanced chips and hardware, there is a significant talent gap in AI and large language models, which is increasingly critical under the pressure of geopolitical fragmentation.

The development of AI requires substantial energy, and the recent U.S. presidential election raised the topic of nuclear energy resumption, which could potentially address Taiwan's energy stability challenges. Constellation announced plans to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, reflecting a shift in attitudes towards nuclear power as a solution for energy demands.

The author argues that without resolving these deficiencies, particularly the energy shortage, government initiatives will fail to have a lasting impact.

Ju-Chun Ko, a member of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, emphasizes the critical issues Taiwan faces, dubbed the "new five lacks" in the context of international pressures such as the "Taiwan +1" strategy. These issues include energy shortages, talent deficits, inadequate infrastructure, insufficient capabilities to address cross-strait tensions, and a lack of willingness from foreign partners to make concrete commitments.

Noting that U.S. business figures like Warren Buffett have cited geopolitical risks as reasons for withdrawal from investments like TSMC, Ko and experts warn that Taiwan's AI industry, despite its advantages in chips and hardware, suffers from a significant talent gap and struggles in developing large language models (LLM). They question the government's ability to provide real solutions while companies face external pressures.

Furthermore, Ko highlights the importance of stable energy supply for the AI sector and reflects on the U.S. support for nuclear energy despite its green energy advancements‚Äîraising concerns about Taiwan's reliance on imported natural gas in the event of conflict. He criticizes the DPP government for failing to effectively manage cross-strait tensions and urges immediate government action to address the new five lacks, striving to ease growing public anxiety.

Since the U.S. SEC opened the door to Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, the total asset scale of global Bitcoin spot ETFs has exceeded 50 billion USD. This development has contributed to Bitcoin's price remaining in the relatively high range of 60,000 to 65,000 USD. Traditional financial institutions now recognize the value of virtual assets, allowing inexperienced investors to easily enter the market through ETFs. In Taiwan, the Financial Supervisory Commission has also started allowing professional investors with over 30 million in assets, as well as domestic institutions and funds, to purchase Bitcoin spot ETFs through sub-delegations from local and foreign brokerages.

However, the cryptocurrency market still faces challenges from scams, and Taiwan's virtual asset regulatory framework is not expected to be submitted to the legislature until next year. Despite this, millions of people in Taiwan are trading on both domestic and foreign exchanges and assume the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies. High-risk contract and leveraged investments are particularly popular among young investors and are a driving force for foreign exchanges like Binance, whereas local exchanges are restricted to spot trading.

After assuming office, FSC Chairman Peng Jin-long announced the establishment of a "Financial Market Development and Innovation Division" to enhance fintech development and promote regulatory flexibility. Regarding the sub-delegation purchases of Bitcoin spot ETFs, legislator Ju-Chun Ko was the first to raise inquiries, leading to efficient discussions between the FSC and brokerage associations. However, most individual Bitcoin investors do not qualify as professional investors and their willingness to invest in Bitcoin spot ETFs through sub-delegation remains uncertain.

The upcoming Tainan Web3 International Expo, focusing on blockchain and virtual assets, highlights Tainan's significant role in Taiwan‚Äôs semiconductor and optoelectronic industries. Tainan has made strides with the Tainan Science Park, homes to major investments from TSMC, and blockchain technology is essential for Taiwan's international competitiveness. Overall, the integration of software and hardware in Tainan is anticipated to create new opportunities for the local industry and offer pathways for the youth.

Since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened up Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, the total asset size globally has exceeded $50 billion. This has become a key factor supporting Bitcoin prices, which are currently consolidating between $60,000 and $65,000. Traditional financial institutions' acknowledgment of virtual asset values has also made it easier for new investors to access Bitcoin through ETFs. In Taiwan, the Financial Supervisory Commission has allowed professional investors with over $30 million in assets, as well as domestic institutions and funds, to purchase Bitcoin spot ETFs through entrusted methods from local and foreign brokerage firms.

However, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies remain popular tools for scams, and Taiwan's virtual asset regulatory framework won't be presented to the Legislative Yuan until next year. Despite this, millions of people in Taiwan already trade on domestic and foreign exchanges. High-risk leveraged investments are particularly attractive to younger investors, contributing to the popularity of foreign exchanges like Binance.

Following the appointment of Chairman Peng Jin-long, the Financial Supervisory Commission has announced the establishment of a "Financial Market Development and Innovation Division" to enhance fintech development and promote regulatory flexibility. Legislator Ju-Chun Ko has actively pushed for the discussion of buying Bitcoin spot ETFs through entrusted trading, demonstrating an efficient response from regulatory authorities.

Nonetheless, most individual investors interested in Bitcoin do not fall into the category of professional investors with $30 million in assets, leading to uncertainty about how many will utilize the entrusted method for purchases. Furthermore, many cryptocurrency-related scams have been reported in central and southern Taiwan, indicating a need for better education on virtual assets.

The upcoming Tainan Web3 International Expo on October 18 aims to promote blockchain and virtual assets, highlighting the region's efforts in the tech industry and its importance in the global semiconductor and optoelectronics sectors. Tainan's advancements, particularly in semiconductors, position it well to create new opportunities and pathways for local youth.

President Lai Ching-te has emphasized the development of AI in Taiwan before and after the election, with the government allocating a total of NT$146.6 billion for technology development plans in the upcoming budget. This includes NT$157.48 billion for the "Taiwan AI Action Plan 2.0."

KMT Legislator Ju-Chun KO argues that Taiwan's AI efforts are becoming marginalized due to a fragmented approach, with multiple centers lacking integration. He warns that without improvement, the AI industry may face severe fragmentation. KMT legislator Lai Shih-Po also notes that while Lai Ching-te aims to position Taiwan as an "AI island," Taiwan ranks poorly at 25th globally in AI readiness compared to Singapore and South Korea.

Additionally, People‚Äôs Party Legislator Chang Chih-kai highlights the importance of stable energy supply for realizing the AI vision.

After President Lai Ching-te took office, efforts to combat fraud intensified, yet fraudulent cases continue to emerge. According to TPOC, the online sentiment analysis showed that the Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) received the highest negative sentiment regarding fraud prevention efforts, followed by the National Communications Commission (NCC) and the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC).

TPOC's findings indicated that MODA faced 12,000 negative comments with a poor favorable rating (P/N value) of 0.35. The NCC also saw significant criticism with 5,615 negative comments and a low rating of 0.33, while the FSC followed with 5,080 negative comments and a rating of 0.71. Other related agencies received less negative sentiment overall but still did not see positive sentiments exceed negatives.

The analysis underscored criticism from legislators of all political affiliations towards MODA's former minister, Audrey Tang, for ineffective fraud prevention, despite substantial spending. It was noted that the NCC has been blamed for inadequate regulation of telecom companies, allowing them to sell unverified numbers to fraud groups. Allegations emerged involving a former NCC member consulting for a telecom firm implicated in illegal practices, stirring public outrage.

TPOC urged that both MODA and the NCC need to strengthen their oversight of telecom operators to uphold government commitments against fraud, or risk losing credibility in their anti-fraud campaigns and perpetuating Taiwan's negative image as a "fraud island."

The Taiwan Issues Research Center (TPOC) analyzed public sentiment data concerning various government agencies involved in combating fraud, including the Digital Development Ministry and the National Communications Commission (NCC). According to their findings, the Digital Development Ministry received significant public backlash, with a negative sentiment volume of 12,000, while the NCC followed closely with 5,615 negative mentions. Both agencies have been criticized for their ineffective anti-fraud measures, despite substantial funding aimed at preventing scams. Various lawmakers from different parties harshly questioned the performance of these agencies in the legislature.

Notably, the NCC faced criticism for its failure to regulate telecom operators, which have reportedly sold unregistered phone numbers to fraud groups. Recent incidents involving former NCC officials have further intensified public outrage. Meanwhile, major telecommunications companies also exhibited varying public sentiment, with FarEasTone leading in positive sentiment, while Chunghwa Telecom struggled due to its association with fraud activities.

The general public is becoming increasingly frustrated with persistent scam calls and messages, holding the Digital Development Ministry and NCC accountable for their inadequacies in tackling these issues. The agencies must enhance their oversight of telecom operators and fulfill their anti-fraud commitments to restore public trust and address Taiwan's reputation as a "scam island."

In recent years, rampant scams in Taiwan have led to public dissatisfaction. The government has been actively combating fraud through inter-agency collaboration, forming a so-called "anti-fraud national team," but results have not met expectations, and scam groups continue to thrive. According to TPOC Taiwan Issues Research Center's analysis of public sentiment data, the Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) has received the highest negative feedback regarding anti-fraud efforts, while the National Communications Commission (NCC) has the lowest public approval.

TPOC gathered online discussion data about various agencies involved in anti-fraud measures, with MODA facing 12,000 negative comments and a poor approval rating of 0.35. The NCC follows with 5,615 negative comments and a rating of 0.33. Other agencies like the Financial Supervisory Commission also received a significant amount of negative feedback.

The negative sentiment towards MODA and the NCC stems from public criticism of their inefficacy in controlling fraud-related communications. Notably, MODA was chastised in the legislature for ineffective spending, while the NCC faced backlash for lax regulation over telecom providers that sold unverified numbers used for scams. Additionally, issues surrounding a former NCC commissioner involved in questionable telecom practices stirred further public outrage.

TPOC noted that public frustration is palpable due to the pervasive nature of scam calls and messages, which have impacted people's lives significantly. Many believe that telecom operators should also bear responsibility in preventing fraud.

Recent analysis showed variable public sentiment across Taiwan's major telecom companies, with FarEasTone leading in approval, while Chunghwa Telecom faced criticism for being complicit in facilitating scams through unchecked number allocations.

TPOC emphasizes the need for MODA and the NCC to strengthen oversight of telecom operators to uphold their anti-fraud promises. Failure to do so risks solidifying Taiwan's reputation as a "scam island."

#### [New Anti-Fraud Regulations Implemented, Cryptocurrency Sector Still Awaits Dedicated Legislation](https://ec.ltn.com.tw/article/paper/1662344) `Ëá™Áî±ÊôÇÂ†±`

In Taiwan, the regulation of virtual currencies (cryptocurrencies) is initially based on industry self-regulation, with amendments made to the Anti-Money Laundering Act. The establishment of a specialized law for the cryptocurrency industry has yet to be formally discussed. Most in the crypto sector are optimistic about self-regulation, but the increasing detail in regulations leads to higher compliance costs for businesses and challenges for foreign investments. Experts argue for the need to establish specific laws quickly, as the industry is adapting to stricter regulations. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) plans to submit a draft law by the end of the year to address this situation. Those familiar with the sector express concerns that the current regulations mirror traditional financial rules, which could limit operational flexibility.

Kuomintang lawmaker Ju-Chun KO emphasizes that any specialized law should reflect the unique nature of the cryptocurrency industry, calling for the proper enforcement tools and an understanding between regulators and the industry. He maintains a positive perspective on the interaction between the industry and regulatory authorities.

#### [Ranking of Negative Sentiment Towards State-Owned Enterprises: Taipower Tops, Chunghwa Telecom Criticized by Legislators](https://udn.com/news/story/6656/8165539) `UDN`

The Taiwan Public Opinion Center (TPOC) has conducted an analysis on the negative online sentiment directed at over 30 state-owned enterprises under the Lai administration, revealing that Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) is at the top with more than 148,000 negative mentions. Issues such as electricity price hikes and supply stability have drawn significant negative attention. Other entities followed, including Taiwan Railways with over 39,000 negative mentions due to incidents like the Taroko Express disaster, and Taiwan Sugar with over 34,000 mentions linked to a food safety scandal.

These findings suggest that state-owned enterprises frequently become targets of criticism, especially when legislators raise concerns about their operations. Notably, China Telecom faced criticism for being involved in a phone surveillance scandal, accumulating around 16,000 negative mentions. This scrutiny reflects broader concerns over managerial practices and potential collusion tied to political affiliations, indicating that public sentiment and online data should inform future personnel decisions in these entities to mitigate backlash and enhance government credibility.

Legislators, including Ju-Chun Ko, have called out these companies, amplifying the negative discourse surrounding them.

#### [Opinion Piece: Is the Kuomintang's Central Thought Reduced to "Anti-DPPism"?](https://www.storm.mg/article/5220630) `È¢®ÂÇ≥Â™í`

Before this year's presidential election, Kuomintang (KMT) vice-presidential candidate Chao Shao-Kang addressed the party's youth policy, emphasizing the need for a clear and relatable central ideology to attract young voters. He criticized the KMT's lack of a substantial central stance since losing power, which has relegated its position to merely being against the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).

The KMT does engage in various youth activities through its youth organizations and has a relatively young candidate list. However, they still struggle with perceptions of being outdated and disconnected from the Taiwanese identity, especially given the ongoing tensions with mainland China. While the KMT aims to present a friendlier stance toward the mainland, this is seen as not aligning with the DPP's stronger emphasis on local identity and political rhetoric, leading to doubts about the KMT's commitment to Taiwan.

The KMT's primary narrative centers on opposing the DPP, but it fails to articulate why voters should support the KMT over the DPP. This has inadvertently strengthened third-party movements, such as the Taiwan People's Party, as voters looking for alternatives find more compelling options than the KMT.

#### [What strategies does the Kuomintang have to attract young people?](https://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20240812000602-260118) `‰∏≠ÊôÇÊñ∞ËÅûÁ∂≤`

Before this year's presidential election, KMT vice presidential candidate Zhao Shaokang emphasized that the party needs a core ideology to attract young voters, criticizing the party's long-standing focus solely on "anti-DPP sentiment." Despite KMT's efforts to engage youth through various activities and initiatives led by tech legislator Ju-Chun KO, there remains a struggle to resonate with the younger demographic.

Zhao pointed out that KMT's attempts to shed the "anti-Taiwan" label have left its core ideology lacking. The ongoing deterioration of cross-strait relations under the DPP's administration has resulted in a more localized narrative that emphasizes "anti-China" sentiments, thus diminishing KMT's appeal.

Voters are confused about KMT's stance, especially as the party balances the desire for good cross-strait relations while distancing itself from mainland China. While KMT has the potential to serve as both a "local party" and a bridge for cross-strait exchange, enhancing its connection to Taiwan's local culture while maintaining stable relations with China could improve public support and rehabilitate its image. This dual focus may enable KMT to attract voters who feel it does not sufficiently prioritize local interests.

#### [Is "Anti-DPPism" the Only Core Ideology of the Kuomintang? (By Yu-Hsiang Jan)](https://www.chinatimes.com/opinion/20240811002713-262110) `‰∏≠ÊôÇÊñ∞ËÅûÁ∂≤`

Before this year's presidential election, KMT vice-presidential candidate Zhao Shao-kang emphasized the need for the Kuomintang (KMT) to adopt a central ideology to attract young supporters. He noted that merely providing opportunities for young members to advance within the party is insufficient. Despite efforts from KMT youth initiatives, including activities organized by their Youth Department and virtual platforms led by tech legislator Ju-Chun KO, the party struggles with perceptions of being "too old" and lacking a sincere commitment to Taiwan, especially in light of their "anti-DPP" stance.

Zhao critiques that the KMT's identity is too focused on opposing the DPP rather than presenting clear, appealing policies to voters. Additionally, the party's approach to cross-strait relations has become cautious, trying to distance itself from pro-China labels while still pivoting toward local conciliation. With the rise of alternative parties, especially the Taiwan People's Party, many voters feel they have better options than the KMT.

The author argues that the KMT has an advantage in being able to bridge local interests and cross-strait dialogue. By fostering local culture while maintaining communication with China, the KMT could potentially redefine its image and dispel the notion of being "not Taiwanese enough." Achieving this balance would require substantial resources and a shift away from the singular focus on anti-DPP rhetoric. Ultimately, winning the hearts of the youth is key to regaining political ground.

A portion of lawmakers from various parties are scheduled to travel to the U.S. on the 19th for election observation, which reduces the likelihood of an extraordinary session being convened.

Due to the travel of several lawmakers, scheduling an extraordinary meeting during this period could alter the composition of those voting and affect the outcomes of proposals.

Taiwan is currently working on self-regulatory guidelines for the virtual asset industry, paving the way for future legislation. At the ABS Summit, legislators and experts noted that the conditions for establishing specific regulations are not yet complete, making it not the best timing for such legislation. Ju-Chun KO pointed out the need for regulatory authorities to have appropriate tools for managing virtual currencies, including tracking tools and analytical software, to ensure effective oversight. He emphasized that regulatory enforcement must be fair and avoid misconceptions about the industry, allowing for a flexible legal framework that can adapt to rapid market changes.

Ju-Chun KO gave examples of Singapore's proactive vetting mechanism allowing many crypto firms to apply for internal management verification and Japan's licensing system that protects consumer interests, especially highlighted during the FTX incident. In contrast, Taiwan is combining anti-money laundering with self-regulatory rules, allowing businesses to establish their own defense mechanisms while planning to create specific regulations.

He noted Taiwan's leading position in crypto technology, with many companies involved in cryptocurrency and blockchain research since 2008. The Chairperson of the Accounting Research and Development Foundation, Wang Yihsin, also mentioned that blockchain has significantly expedited accounting processes in Taiwan. The Taiwan VASP Association is actively discussing self-regulation with the Financial Supervisory Commission, promoting a balanced approach that combines regulation and innovation.

In response, the Ministry of Economic Affairs's deputy minister and the Nuclear Safety Commission chairman stated that they "respect" the opinions of the legislators but did not provide a straightforward endorsement for the amendment. Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators stressed that there is no social consensus on the amendment and questioned its practical implications.

DPP lawmaker Wu Pei-yi pointed out that any extension of nuclear power operation should be treated like a new nuclear plant regarding environmental assessments, emphasizing the unresolved issue of nuclear waste. Discussions concluded with the chairman suggesting further review at a later date.

#### [Talent Scramble: 1111 "Tech Industry Talent Shortage" Public Hearing ‚Äì Industry Insights](https://www.storm.mg/article/5184946) `È¢®ÂÇ≥Â™í`

A survey indicates that 85% of the technology industry holds a positive view for the economic outlook in the second half of the year, with 22.9% anticipating improvement and 62.2% expecting stability, while only 14.9% foresee a decline. Despite the varied perspectives on the economy, the sector faces a significant talent shortage, with 96% of tech companies planning to hire, particularly for entry-level and mid-skilled positions.

Legislators Ju-Chun Ko, Chang Chi-kai, and Chang Ya-lin organized a public hearing titled "Tech Talent Shortage and Solutions" to address this issue. National Taiwan University‚Äôs School of Electrical Engineering Dean, Chang Yao-wen, emphasized that talent is fundamental to national and industrial development. Factors contributing to the shortage include declining birth rates, talent outflow, reduced representation of engineering and science students, weakened math and science education, and rigid educational systems.

Legislator Chang Chi-kai highlighted the need for hardware talent in addition to the existing software expertise in Taiwan, noting the successes in AI and semiconductors, but stressing the importance of addressing energy consumption and the recruitment of foreign talent.

Ju-Chun Ko pointed out the stark talent gap, estimating a shortage of 24,000 AI professionals despite producing 3,500 annually. Strategies to attract international talent should focus on improving work-life balance and showcasing Taiwan's strengths, within the framework of policies like the New Southbound Policy.

Yeh Chih-cheng of the National Science and Technology Council mentioned initiatives to enhance interdisciplinary talent training and public-private partnerships. Labor representatives stressed the necessity of improving work conditions to retain talent amidst competitive pressures, citing a lack of innovation as a primary reason for declining attractiveness in the tech industry.

Lastly, the Ministry of Labor's training and development team described efforts to bridge the gap between education and industry needs, including creating a platform for workforce supply-demand collaboration and facilitating policy adjustments to retain international graduates in Taiwan.

Collaborative efforts from government, academia, and industry are necessary for both nurturing domestic talent and attracting international professionals.

Experts proposed solutions involving career training, increasing the proportion of STEM graduates, and improving working conditions to attract and retain talent, particularly in light of declining birth rates and global talent competition.

Recently, there have been reports of graduate students being scammed by fraudulent international academic conferences and some university teachers spending money to publish in predatory journals for promotions. The Ministry of Education in Taiwan plans to hold a meeting on the 25th with public and private universities to discuss countermeasures. Scholars note that students registering for fake conferences suggest that their advisors have not exercised proper oversight, while teachers publishing in predatory journals are simply causing trouble for themselves.

Legislator Ju-Chun KO pointed out an incident where a National Taiwan University student spent over 30,000 TWD to register for a nonexistent conference. Younger faculty members often resort to predatory journals to meet promotion criteria quickly, but this practice is deemed a form of academic fraud.

The Ministry of Education aims to discuss preventive measures against such scams, including establishing a verification system for academic conferences to help assess their legitimacy within a short timeframe. However, concerns remain regarding the feasibility of holding foreign scam organizations accountable and whether offering compensations would inadvertently incentivize more scams.

Chancellor Wu Dongxing of Jinan University expressed that students should typically have institutional support to avoid such scams and that supervisors must take responsibility for guiding them. Furthermore, while publishing in predatory journals might seem attractive for personal research output, it can harm academic careers and jeopardize promotion prospects.

According to a report by ETtoday, the current Legislative Yuan in Taiwan has 113 members, with the highest representation from Libra and Capricorn, each occupying 15 seats. This contrasts with the previous session, which had 7 Aquarians, a group notably absent this time.

Astrologer Yunwei described Libras as excellent communicators and diplomats who strive for fairness, while Capricorns are pragmatic, resilient, and known for their organization. The report notes that the presence of Libras and Capricorns may influence legislative dynamics positively, as they often seek harmony and coordinated solutions.

Among the notable members, Ju-Chun KO (ËëõÂ¶ÇÈàû), known as "Dr. Bao," represents the Leo sign and is one of 12 Leos in the current assembly. In contrast, the absence of Aquarians is unexpected, given their previous role emphasizing social concerns and humanitarian ideals.

Recently, issues have arisen in the Legislative Yuan regarding Chairman Han Kuo-yu's refusal to join party group chats and his perceived neutrality in discussions, leading to dissatisfaction among Kuomintang (KMT) legislators, particularly Chen Yu-chan. Media commentator Huang Yang-ming stated that during a questioning session, KMT legislator Ju-Chun KO was retorted by Premier Chen Chien-jen, but Ju-Chun did not seek Han's intervention, so the blame should not fall on Han. Huang emphasized that Han has not made any mistakes and is still familiarizing himself with the dynamics between the DPP and the People's Party.

The KMT‚Äôs frustration stems from Han's handling of specific situations, such as not reprimanding Chen Chien-jen during Ju-Chun's questioning and showing support for certain DPP members. Huang argued that while some KMT lawmakers express dissatisfaction, the party seems too eager for Han to confront the DPP. Furthermore, he pointed out that the KMT can pass proposals independently without relying on other officials‚Äô input.

Ultimately, Huang characterized the current tensions as political strife rather than a failure of Han's leadership.

#### [Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu Too Neutral? Blue Legislators Discontented, Huang Wei-han Shouts "Full Support"](https://www.nownews.com/news/6401099) `‰ªäÊó•Êñ∞ËÅû`

Media reports have revealed internal discussions among Kuomintang (KMT) legislators about dissatisfaction with Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu's perceived neutrality, as he has not particularly supported KMT members. Ju-Chun KO and Premier Chen Chien-jen argued without Han intervening, and KMT Secretary-General Chou Wan-lai hinted that the U.S. President would not face immediate responses upon visiting Congress. The most frustration stemmed from Han not joining the KMT's legislative group chat.

In response, KMT legislators Chen Yu-jen and Hsu Chiao-hsin suggested that Han should join the party group chat but did not criticize him. Huang Wei-han emphasized that Han, as Speaker, should maintain neutrality and not engage in party matters, asserting that a Speaker who does so enhances their popularity beyond that of the KMT itself. Huang acknowledged the disappointment among KMT members but argued that Han's rational approach is necessary to attract more centrist voters.

After taking office as the president of the Legislative Yuan, Han Kuo-yu has faced dissatisfaction from some Kuomintang (KMT) legislators for adhering to the principle of impartiality in proceedings. Media commentator Huang Wei-han expressed confusion about this reaction, stating that the president should maintain neutrality and not engage in party affairs.

Reports indicate that some KMT members, including legislator Chen Yu-jen, have criticized Han for not favoring their party, arguing that he should join their group chat to communicate their views on legislation. Huang argued that while KMT legislators expected support from Han, they should understand that his impartial stance is essential for attracting moderate voters.

Public sentiment appears to support Han's neutral approach, with comments highlighting the need for practical discussions rather than sensationalism, reinforcing that Taiwan is a rule-of-law society that demands adherence to the law regardless of who is in power.

The recent discussions on defining the boundaries between two-dimensional creations and child protection have gained momentum. The Ministry of Health and Welfare decided that local governments will determine the legality of content. However, both the Comic Union and the Anime Association raised concerns that excessive regulations could harm Taiwan's local comic development. Culture Minister Shih Che expressed the importance of safeguarding both child protection and creative freedom, suggesting a graded system and warning labels as preliminary protective measures.

The "iWIN Internet Content Protection Mechanism" recently removed adult content from PTT users for violating child sexual exploitation regulations, sparking controversy. During a report at the Legislative Yuan, lawmakers including Hong Meng-kai, Luo Ting-wei, and Ju-Chun Ko questioned Shih on the ministry's stance regarding the iWIN incident.

Shih agreed on the necessity of child protection while also championing creator freedom. He acknowledged the current local jurisdiction approach but stressed a unified standard is important. He supported initial measures like a grading system and warning labels, representing significant support for creators, noting that the discussion on clear standards is ongoing.

He argues that these standards may be overly vague, fearing that such measures could prevent innocent characters, like those from "Sailor Moon" and "Chibi Maruko-chan," from engaging in normal storylines, such as transformations or interactions with family. While the Minister of Culture, Shih Che, acknowledges the importance of addressing child welfare issues, he emphasizes the need to protect creative expression and provide clearer guidelines for content creators.

The discussion was heightened after a platform removed content featuring "youth-like" characters due to concerns about child exploitation laws.

Many ACG fans believe real-world regulations should not extend to virtual creations. Lawmaker Ju-Chun KO (ËëõÂ¶ÇÈàû) urged the Ministry of Culture to advocate for creators, warning that if regulations continue this way, iconic figures like Sailor Moon could be restricted. Minister of Culture Shih Che responded by emphasizing the importance of protecting youth while also supporting the creative space through classification and warning systems.

The debate escalated after the Ministry of Health and Welfare confirmed potential youth sexual exploitation in a reported game featuring characters resembling children, generating backlash from online communities who argue the standards for defining such cases are vague.

#### [Wei Longsheng's Perspective: Viewing Zhou Li-Lun's Reform of the KMT Positively](https://www.storm.mg/article/5056767) `È¢®ÂÇ≥Â™í`

In the past two weeks, Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Eric Chu announced the largest and most thorough reform plan for the party since he took office. This reform encompasses the central party and think tanks, featuring both organizational changes and personnel adjustments, sparking significant discussion both within and outside the party. The author observes and analyzes that this reform should be viewed positively.

Chu's reforms aim at youth engagement, internal strengthening, and simplification. While there may be communication issues, overall, the reforms align with social expectations and the current situation of the KMT. The timing coincides with discussions among scholars from the pan-blue camp post-election, demonstrating the party‚Äôs responsiveness to supporter demands.

The core of any reform lies in personnel; suitable individuals in the right positions are essential for effective organizational adjustment. The KMT traditionally has talented members, but their effectiveness diminishes if they are not in appropriate roles. The author highlights concerns that the KMT's structural politics, unlike the DPP, do not facilitate incline negotiations for reform, hence requiring a sufficient number of reform-minded individuals to be effective.

The KMT's reform process is described as gradual and interconnected across central, local, and legislative bodies. Given the party's financial turmoil and the need for a nimble, combative structure, the internal strengthening is presented as a logical solution.

Longstanding burdens hinder the KMT's evolution, with many believing the DPP will soon stumble, thus diminishing the urgency for internal adjustments. The party‚Äôs image necessitates change, advocating for the integration of the Huang Fu-Xing branch with broader party operations, allowing for greater talent development.

Emphasizing youth, Chu has formed the "KMT Studio" to merge youth groups, appointing Ju-Chun Ko, an expert in social media and blockchain technologies, to lead. This strategic move aims to enhance youth engagement and adaptability to new digital landscapes.

Overall, Chu's reforms are a bold response to longstanding issues, yet their success will largely depend on their outcomes and the party's ability to generate tangible results moving forward.

#### [The Premier Needs to Feel the Pain of the People Being Defrauded](https://udn.com/news/story/7339/7845345) `UDN`

The issue of fraud has become a major concern for the public, particularly following the establishment of the Ministry of Digital Development, which seems to have exacerbated the problem. In this context, KMT legislator Ju-Chun KO utilized AI technology during a legislative inquiry to highlight the evolving nature of fraud methods, which are difficult for the public to detect, even fooling Premier Chen Chien-Jen.

While Premier Chen may feel angry about being deceived in a public setting, the concern grows when even Minister Audrey Tang could not verify the authenticity of a video. This raises doubts about the government's effectiveness in combating fraud.

The public's suffering from fraud, as seen through the eyes of victims, should be better appreciated by officials like Premier Chen. There have been instances of fleeing fraudsters, leaving victims feeling hopeless, especially when legal actions lead to no resolutions.

It is crucial for the government to understand the gravity of the fraud issue from the people's perspective, rather than merely advising caution without taking strong deterrent actions against perpetrators. If the authorities do not address the problem effectively, public trust in the government will continue to erode.

#### [United Daily News - Does Chen Chien-Jen Really Understand the Feeling of Being Cheated?](https://udn.com/news/story/7338/7845308) `UDN`

In a significant moment during legislative questioning, Kuomintang's newly elected lawmaker Ju-Chun KO (ËëõÂ¶ÇÈàû), an AI expert, presented two videos to Premier Chen Chien-jen, asking him to identify which one was AI-generated and which was real. After examining them, Chen guessed that the one on the right seemed more real. However, KO revealed that both videos were AI-generated, shocking Chen into an emotional outburst where he accused KO of setting a trap and called him a fraud.

Chen's reaction raises questions about the gravity of his response to a mistaken identification in a legislative setting, which is not a game or a court, and highlights the critical issue of distinguishing real from fake when it comes to scams. Despite the government promoting measures against fraud, such as avoiding contact and transactions, this does little to prevent the more sophisticated schemes currently emerging, including those utilizing AI.

While Chen felt deceived, it‚Äôs crucial to consider whether he truly understands the gravity of being scammed, especially for those who have lost their life savings or investments. A genuine empathic response towards the victims of fraud would illustrate how much he has missed the expectations of the public.

In Taiwan, the "Electronic Signature Act" has not been amended for over 20 years. The Digital Development Ministry has proposed amendments, which have passed the Executive Yuan's review. Tomorrow, the Legislative Yuan's Transportation Committee will separately examine the government's version and the revision proposed by legislator Ju-Chun KO and 22 other lawmakers.

There are two major differences between the two proposals. First, the legislative version adds a requirement for the responsible authority to regularly collect data on the application of electronic signatures in Taiwan and publish annual reports. The Digital Development Ministry appreciates this suggestion and is already planning a survey regarding the current status and needs related to the use of electronic signatures.

Second, concerning the sunset clause that exempts certain agencies from the act's application, the government proposes a 3-year period, while the legislative version suggests 1 year. The ministry hopes to communicate effectively with administrative agencies to eliminate such exemptions as soon as possible.

The key points of the government's proposal include the legal parity of electronic and physical documents, a clear definition of digital signatures, and provisions for including international certificate authority recognition.

The new session of the Legislative Yuan has begun, with the Kuomintang (KMT) proposing numerous reform bills. However, they have faced fierce criticism from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) group leader Ker Chien-Ming, who accuses them of undermining the constitution. Political commentator and KMT legislator Hsieh Lung-Chieh‚Äôs nephew, Hsieh Ke-Yang, analyzes that Ker has entered an aggressive mode, aiming to be the commander on the main battleground, and warns KMT members to be cautious of escalating attacks.

Hsieh Ke-Yang stated on Facebook that Ker Chien-Ming is particularly agitated this term, labeling any queries or proposals from KMT legislators negatively to target those vulnerable in the party. He recalls that Ker's previous agitation was seen during the Hsinchu City mayoral election campaign, where he frequently attacked Mayor Kao Hung-An.

Hsieh Ke-Yang implies that with the DPP losing the majority, Ker lacks the resources to pass various bills strongly as before, opting instead for comprehensive attacks on KMT members. He notes that Ker's strategy aims to turn the Legislative Yuan into a battleground, shifting blame for DPP's governance failures onto the KMT.

The Legislative Yuan's Legal Affairs Bureau recently released a report on the "Overseas Absentee Voting System," highlighting that over ten countries, including the US, Austria, Germany, and Hungary, implement various forms of absentee voting, such as communication and transfer voting. However, it emphasizes that not all methods significantly increase voter turnout, as effectiveness depends on the design and implementation of the system.

Currently, there are four versions of the "National Civic Voting Absentee Voting Act" pending review in the Legislative Yuan. The Executive Yuan's version allows voters to apply for absentee voting 60 days in advance. Proposals by lawmakers, including Ju-Chun KO (ËëõÂ¶ÇÈàû), advocate for incorporating communication voting and establishing special polling places.

The report indicates that absentee voting can include numerous types: communication voting (mail-in), transfer voting (voting at a different polling place), special polling places (in hospitals, military camps, etc.), proxy voting, early voting, electronic voting, and overseas voting.

Electronic voting, though convenient, poses significant risks, and currently only Estonia fully supports it. Many countries, including the US and various European nations, employ a mix of absentee voting methods based on their policy choices and specific circumstances, underscoring the idea that there is no universal solution to increasing voter participation. Each country's approach to absentee voting is influenced by its unique environment and regulatory framework.

The restructuring will also affect the think tank, with its CEO Ke Zhi'en retained, while the integration of legislative committees into the think tank aims to enhance collaboration between policy formulation and party unity.

This organizational overhaul appears to be extensive, with final reform proposals expected to be reviewed soon by the party‚Äôs central committee.

KMT legislator Ju-Chun KO expressed concerns in the Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee regarding the recent SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Following this, Taiwanese brokers received notice from the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) stating that they can only sell linked virtual assets through sub-delegation and cannot add new buy orders. This affects 21 ETFs in U.S. and Hong Kong markets.

FSC Chairman Huang Tianmu clarified that while brokers can offer products approved via sub-delegation, due to the high volatility and lack of intrinsic value of virtual assets, an initial prohibition exists. However, the FSC is not entirely prohibiting purchases and is open to proposals from the broker's association for including Bitcoin spot ETFs by the end of April.

Huang emphasized that Bitcoin's value is unrelated to the real economy, a consensus among regulatory bodies worldwide. The recent market response stems from a court ruling that invalidated the SEC's prohibition on the Bitcoin spot ETF. Meanwhile, Deputy Director of the Securities Bureau, Gao Jingping, noted that the FSC will evaluate the possibility of allowing investors to purchase Bitcoin spot ETFs after input from the broker association.

In January, an ETF tracking Bitcoin was approved for listing by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In response, Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has initially prohibited trading in virtual asset-linked spot and futures products through sub-delegated mandates. If securities firms wish to include Bitcoin spot ETFs under sub-delegated trading, they must submit a supporting plan by the end of April. KMT legislator Ju-Chun KO expressed concerns about the implications of the SEC's approval following a court ruling. SEC's earlier prohibition on Bitcoin spot ETFs was deemed ineffective, leading to increased interest in these products. The FSC emphasized that because Bitcoin does not relate to the real economy and lacks inherent value, they are cautious about permitting investments in such assets.

Wan Meiling inquired whether the Ministry has encountered illegal cases involving ghostwriting for portfolios and if there were penalties involved.

Ju-Chun Ko raised concerns about a recent fire at the Ministry's tech building that jeopardized the stability of learning portfolios. He also referenced a previous incident in 2021 involving data loss due to an outsourcing error.

Additionally, Ko advised on the importance of data backup, suggesting that there should be at least three copies of the data stored in different locations, both online and offline.

In the recent election of committee chairs in the Legislative Yuan, both the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) secured one chair each. KMT Chairman Eric Chu encouraged legislators to participate in various committees, but the inability of professional KMT legislators to join their relevant committees sparked public discussion. The selection process employed by the KMT and DPP involved a point system based on seniority and committee assignments, resulting in some professionals being unable to enter relevant committees. Newly elected legislators expressed a desire to showcase their expertise, but the KMT's new coordination method, which aimed to streamline the process, also hindered some professionals from obtaining suitable placements. While KMT legislators like Wang Hsiu-Ling and Ju-Chun KO asserted their capability to contribute in other committees, this situation raises concerns about whether professional talent is being effectively utilized within the legislature. Calls for legislative reform highlight the importance of aligning committee assignments with expertise to enhance civic engagement and policy focus.

Kuomintang legislator Chen Ching-hui advocates for the rights of surrogates and regulations on surrogacy, while Democratic Progressive Party members focus on expanding access for same-sex couples and single women. Legislator Chen Chao-tzu from the People‚Äôs Party aligns closely with Chen Ching-hui's proposals.

Lawmakers, including Chen Ching-hui, Chang Chia-chun, Su Ching-chuan, and Ju-Chun Ko, argue that current laws exclude single women and same-sex couples, violating constitutional rights and not meeting societal needs. They highlight the increasing demand for surrogacy and the stagnation of birth rates as urgent issues that necessitate reform.

Chen Chao-tzu emphasizes the need to legalize surrogacy as a critical aspect of revising the reproductive law and calls for collaboration from all legislators to address this pressing social issue.

He highlighted the outdated nature of the current law, which was established nearly 22 years ago, and stressed the importance of adapting to technological advancements.

Ko pointed out the need for governmental agencies to fully embrace electronic signatures to eliminate long queues and enhance service efficiency, as many public services still require physical signatures. The proposed amendments signify a critical development towards increasing the convenience and acceptance of electronic signatures, not only in the public sector but also in private industry. The executives from various tech firms shared their insights on adopting electronic signatures, emphasizing their security and efficiency benefits compared to traditional methods.

The proposed amendments aim to increase the government's agility in adopting electronic signatures, with a one-year grace period for compliance. The amendments would differentiate digital from electronic signatures, affirm their legal validity, and foster a conducive legal environment for diverse electronic signature development. The Executive Yuan has already approved the draft for legislative priority in the current session.

The "Electronic Signature Act," in effect for over 20 years since 2002, has not kept pace with advancements in technology, leading to a reliance on traditional paper signatures. Kuomintang legislators Ju-Chun Ko, Wu Tsung-hsien, and Hsu Chiao-hsin held a press conference urging the government to adopt electronic signatures boldly. They support a proposed amendment to the law that would recognize electronic documents and signatures as equivalent to physical documents and signatures, thus confirming their legal validity.

Recent amendments by the Executive Yuan may allow a three-year grace period for government agencies, but Ko and Wu advocate for only a one-year delay, stressing that citizens have already waited 22 years. They call for regular reporting on the application status of electronic signatures to the public. Wu emphasizes that the existing law was outdated, originating in an era of dial-up internet, and believes digital signatures will be more secure and widely accepted.

Hsu points out the inefficiencies in public services that require in-person signatures, leading to long lines. The proposed amendment aims to simplify processes by presuming compliance with electronic signatures. Industry leaders argue that current electronic signature services are secure and advocate for broader adoption beyond government-issued certificates to spur industry development.

Recently, a surge of Vietnamese accounts began liking the Facebook page of Zhang Shanzheng, leading to an increase of over a thousand fans in one night. His aides, noticing the unusual activity, consulted with Kuomintang technology legislator Ju-Chun Ko, who acknowledged the oddity of the situation. Ko emphasized that the costs of creating fake followers are decreasing, especially with AI's ability to generate false images and videos, urging the public to be cautious and not to trust suspicious online activities.

Ko stated that online information is becoming increasingly unreliable due to AI-generated misinformation, which makes distinguishing real from fake challenging. Fraud groups can easily manipulate accounts, creating a vast number of fake profiles and posts to mislead the public. He called for vigilance in verifying official information before believing or spreading false claims, particularly urging the government to enhance its anti-fraud efforts.

Local politicians also commented, with Taoyuan City Councilor Liang Weichao highlighting that the influx of fake accounts is either a result of paid followers or intentional manipulation. Since it isn't election season, purchasing followers seems unnecessary, suggesting manipulative actions instead. Another councilor, Zhan Jiangcun, explained that these fake accounts often follow specific pages to influence online discourse, especially during controversies, warning that if unchecked, such activities could continue unabated.

A call for reflection and reform is directed towards the Democratic Progressive Party, which is urged to address issues such as energy policy and instances of corruption, as there is increasing public discontent. The DPP is reminded to prioritize public opinion over party interests to avoid electoral consequences in future elections.

The Kuomintang has shown signs of evolution with younger representatives and seems more open to diverse issues. The inclusion of individuals like AI expert Ju-Chun Ko (ËëõÂ¶ÇÈàû) and others in the party's roster reflects a refreshing change, granting them an opportunity to regain their position as the largest party in the legislature.

Lastly, the Taiwan People's Party has quickly risen to be the third-largest party in the legislature, positioning itself as an essential player in politics. They are encouraged to remain focused on their original mission and uphold neutrality in future legislative efforts, ensuring that they do not compromise the public's interests for party gains.

Recently, Lai Shih-Pao attended a boot camp titled "How to Be a Good Legislator" as a speaker and urged Fu Kun-Chi to engage in a fair competition, hoping that the party leadership would respect the members' voting preferences. Previously, Fu Kun-Chi withdrew from the elections for legislative leadership, and party chairman Zhu Lilun suggested he could be consulted for the legislative strategy, which has fueled speculation about his potential candidacy for the position. Lai noted that during past struggles, he took the lead and suffered injuries, implying that Fu remained uninvolved.

Lai will discuss legislative processes and operations, while fellow legislator Hsu Chiao-Hsin will share strategies for campaigning. The upcoming election for the Kuomintang (KMT) party leader has already generated excitement, potentially getting more intense leading up to the official election date of January 30.

Fu Kun-chi stated that although the time for the KMT group leader election is only one year, it is a crucial moment to expose the DPP's corruption over the past eight years, including issues related to vaccines and masks. He emphasized the need for transparency and reforms in Congress, where elected officials often become tools of the ruling party.

Fu expressed his determination to let the truth be known to the public and highlighted the past failures of Congress reform over the last 30 years. He claimed that true reform would make it difficult for the DPP to find candidates for ministerial positions due to accountability to Congress.

In a light-hearted jab at DPP group leader Ko Chien-ming, Fu claimed that he had never lost to him. He invited new legislators, including Ju-Chun KO, to become strong supporters of the people.

In the 2024 elections, the Kuomintang (KMT) secured 52 legislative seats, becoming the largest party in the Legislative Yuan. Among the newly elected representatives, there is a notable shift towards a younger demographic, with 18 members aged between 30 and 49, accounting for over one-third of the KMT's delegation. Among them, newcomers like **Hsu Chiao-hsin** and **Niu Hsu-ting** represent a departure from the party's older image, and their success indicates a willingness among voters to support a new generation of leaders, like **Ju-Chun Ko**, also known as "Dr. Bao", who is 42 years old and known in the crypto space.

The average age of KMT legislators is around 52, with those from Taichung having the lowest average at 43 years. Young KMT representatives typically lack political familial backgrounds, enhancing their appeal as self-made politicians in the evolving political landscape. However, although the influx of younger legislators signals generational change, critics argue that the party's leadership still lacks the necessary youth and adaptability in modern campaigning, which could hinder their future electoral prospects.

As the KMT navigates this generational transition, focus will be needed on structural reforms within the party for enhanced competitiveness in upcoming elections.

As the countdown to the 2024 election begins, the Kuomintang (KMT) strategizes on how to navigate a three-way race. Party officials note that the "Hou-Zhao pairing" and "Lai-Hsiao pairing" are statistically within the margin of error. To solidify their base, they plan large-scale rallies and increase street canvassing in southern regions where they are weaker, aiming to maximize voter turnout.

Hou You-ih's campaign spokesperson, Wang Min-xu, emphasized ongoing opportunities to connect with voters through street canvassing and social media, highlighting tangible policies proposed by the "Hou-Zhao pairing."

Party officials revealed that internal polls show Hou struggles among younger voters (ages 20-40) and in central and southern areas, with some areas showing a nearly 20% deficit. However, he has strong support from voters over 50 and leads in northern and offshore regions.

To attract younger voters, the KMT is nominating younger, professional candidates for at-large legislative seats, including blockchain expert Ju-Chun KO and infertility specialist Chen Jing-hui, suggesting a commitment to youth representation.

Key campaign activities will take place in areas like Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung, with repeated street canvassing and public speeches at local religious centers to draw in independent voters and boost turnout. The campaign plans a nationwide mobilization for voter persuasion, aiming to solidify support from various demographics and overseas Chinese communities.

The possibility of a strategic vote-splitting maneuver was dismissed by party officials, who are confident in increasing support for Hou You-ih.

Chairman Zhu Lilun stated that the Kuomintang's (KMT) national at-large candidate list demonstrates a commitment to change and reform, featuring a strong, professional, and diverse representation. In contrast, he criticized the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for its candidates being the result of factional distributions and power-sharing, with a significant portion of its safe list filled by incumbent legislators, neglecting representation and professionalism.

Zhu noted that while the DPP seeks to "rescue" Wang Yichuan, whom critics have labeled as a "political puppet," the KMT is focused on saving talents like finance expert Yang Yingchao, mental health specialist Li Yuchan, and representatives for new residents, such as Li Xia.

He emphasized that the KMT's at-large legislative candidates encompass exceptional talents aimed at addressing key issues like blockchain technology, AI, declining birth rates, economic challenges, military strategies, and more. The KMT aims to leverage its collective strength in the upcoming 2024 elections to achieve a political transition for the benefit of the Taiwanese people.

With 30 days until the election, the KMT is invigorated, with nearly 90% of blue camp supporters returning. Recent polls show the gap between "Hou-Kang" and "Lai-Hsiao" is within the margin of error. KMT estimates suggest the final outcome could be close, with only a 5-10% difference. To secure essential votes, "Hou-Kang" emphasizes policies targeting economic voters aged 30-39 and actively combines efforts with at-large legislators to bolster their image.

Recent trends indicate that Lai-Hsiao has a slight edge over Hou-Kang, but internal KMT polling suggests a potential turnaround. Higher-ups note that Hou-Kang is currently more vulnerable among voters aged 20-29, as traditional polling methods may not accurately reflect this demographic. Nonetheless, KMT is focusing on the 30-49 age group.

Hou You-ih's proposed policies, including a 1.5 million loan for first-time homebuyers and free after-school care at public elementary schools, aim to appeal to young and middle-class voters. Collaborations with professional at-large legislators, such as blockchain expert Ju-Chun Ko discussing AI and fraud prevention, are also planned to attract support for Hou-Kang.

Regionally, Hou-Kang lags behind in Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, but Hou You-ih's local roots in Chiayi and his approachable demeanor are expected to enhance his connections with voters. The KMT plans over 20 large-scale events and grassroots mobilization to boost voter turnout.

Finally, if Terry Gou, founder of Foxconn, can rally support at a critical time, it could significantly sway economic and knowledgeable voters, with pro-Gou sentiment already returning to the KMT.

In the upcoming elections, expectations were that if Ko Wen-je ran for president, the seats of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) would significantly increase, leading to a scenario where no single party would hold a majority in the Legislative Yuan (referred to as "three parties not over half"). However, Ko's declining popularity and the TPP's lack of standout candidates suggest that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Kuomintang (KMT) will maintain solid bases, leaving changes in the legislature primarily dependent on these two parties.

After the breakdown of a potential KMT-TPP coalition, the presidential race has evolved with Lai Ching-te leading in polls and KMT's Hou You-ih consolidating the blue base. The current situation for Ko, who has hurt his party‚Äôs strength during coalition talks, indicates he is outpaced by Hou. The interlinked dynamics of presidential votes and party-list votes imply that TPP‚Äôs success depends on how many votes Ko can secure, affecting their legislative representation.

The DPP aims to secure a majority in the legislative elections, while the KMT focuses on gaining seats by strengthening its base through strategic candidate placements. Ko's attempt to attract various factions is complicated by controversies surrounding key candidates. Ultimately, the notion of a "three-party not over half" scenario may be more wishful thinking than likely reality.

Following the global hype around ChatGPT, the breakthrough development of generative artificial intelligence (AIGC) has drawn considerable attention. On the 18th, the Changfeng Foundation held a forum titled "The Impact and Challenges Brought by Generative AI" to discuss the opportunities and disruptions AIGC introduces to human society. Taiwan Microsoft's Chief Technology Officer, Hwa Kai-Lung, emphasized that Microsoft's goal is to make AI act as a "co-pilot" to enhance human capabilities and efficiency.

Changfeng Foundation's CEO, Tsai Yu-Ling, pointed out that AIGC presents numerous opportunities, such as evolving traditional search engines into "answer engines" and speeding up advanced research. However, it also triggers a new wave of industrial revolution, with competition among tech giants described as more intense than the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The impact of AIGC goes beyond industries, challenging talent, legal systems, and social structures.

Ju-Chun Ko, an assistant professor at National Taiwan University, noted that the advent of AIGC could fundamentally redefine what constitutes "talent." As tasks become easier for AI, traditional benchmarks like IQ and EQ may become less relevant, with a new metric, "AIQ" (the ability to intelligently use AI), becoming crucial for future job markets.

In response to concerns about whether tech giants will become even larger in the AIGC era, Hwa acknowledged that competing with large companies would be challenging due to high AI training costs, but he also expressed hope for collaboration with various organizations, including local Taiwanese firms.

On the 18th, the Changfeng Foundation held the "Breakthrough Forum on the Impact and Challenges of Generative AI," discussing the opportunities and disruptions that AIGC brings to human society. iKala CEO Cheng Shih-chia suggested that a "golden age" for the humanities and social sciences is approaching, noting that discussions on teaching programming from a young age are becoming obsolete as AIGC can now engage in natural language dialogue.

Associate Professor Ju-Chun Ko from National Taiwan University pointed out that AIGC could not only augment human intelligence but may also extend to enhancing human physical capabilities in the future. He mentioned the difficulty of finding valuable information as costs for content approach zero but likened this to the transformation of JPGs into NFTs, where every piece of information could become a tradable asset.

Ko emphasized that while the development of tools is fast, individuals should focus on using tools effectively rather than being lost in their pursuit. He believes that the benefits of AIGC outweigh its drawbacks for both individuals and businesses, predicting a future where AIGC allows for significant operational efficiencies.

Cheng also highlighted this moment as a pivotal point, proclaiming it a "golden age" for individual workers, as AI empowers them to achieve results that previously required teamwork. He suggested that companies reconsider their business models in the light of AI's potential to boost efficiency and marketing effectiveness. Both speakers recognized that the developments in AI signal a transformative period for society as a whole.

#### [Virtual Currency Has Not Yet Formed a Bubble! NFT Expert Dr. Bao: From This Perspective, It Has Not Happened Yet.](https://tw.nextapple.com/finance/20220907/0183162F045CAE662EF417BC9F2823D2) `Â£πËòãÊñ∞ËÅûÁ∂≤`

Dr. Bao, known as a missionary in the NFT world, has been exploring the metaverse for many years. He was the first user from Taiwan invited by Instagram to connect NFTs with accounts after the feature was opened. Despite the current cryptocurrency winter, Kikitrade, a social crypto platform, invited him to share exclusive insights on NFTs.

Dr. Bao is optimistic about the future of the metaverse and the blockchain industry. He compares it to the early days of JPG and MP3 formats, which were initially difficult for people to envision as they evolved into integral parts of social and music platforms. He believes NFTs are at a very early stage, primarily seen as digital art or certificates now, but will grow into a large industry similar to how JPG and MP3 did.

He explains that NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are a structure that allows digital files (like JPGs and PNGs) to be recorded on a blockchain. Despite rumors of an NFT bubble, he notes that not everyone has experienced significant losses, as few people are actually lamenting their NFT investments online.

As one of Taiwan's early promoters of NFTs, Dr. Bao is fascinated by the autonomy they offer users in an increasingly controlled social media landscape. He believes NFTs return digital rights to individuals, even though losing them means they are irretrievable. The underlying technology, smart contracts, allows continuous development and integration of technology, art, design, and commerce, which excites him about the potential of the industry.

When discussing his favorite NFT projects, Dr. Bao mentions various artists like Pak, Beeple, and Kevin Abosch, along with his recent favorite, CLONEX, which has introduced a 3D paper doll system allowing collectors to create and pose digital avatars easily. He appreciates how RTFKT, the parent company of CLONEX, embraces creativity and innovation in the NFT space.

In a report by journalist Ou Yu-Hsiang, the trends in the cryptocurrency market, particularly the growing popularity of NFTs (non-fungible tokens), are examined. Ju-Chun KO, known as "Dr. Bao" and an assistant professor at Taipei Tech's Department of Interactive Design, notes that the NFT market is emerging in Taiwan, presenting both significant investment risks and potential "early bonuses" for early adopters.

He compares the NFT market to the nascent days of social media, recognizing its potential for growth but also the risk of a bubble. While many companies are capitalizing on this trend, they face practical challenges, such as conservative attitudes from accounting firms towards virtual currencies and NFTs, which could deter investments. Liu Li-En, CEO of a blockchain platform, emphasizes that the lack of understanding among accountants and regulatory bodies complicates matters.

KO argues that if government regulations on NFTs are too stringent, it could stifle the market's growth in Taiwan, suggesting that minimal regulation might be preferable. Both he and Liu express that the NFT market bears the typical uncertainties of new ventures, where consumer interest and the appeal of intellectual property are crucial to success, likening the desirability of an NFT to established entities like Disney compared to lesser-known ones.

He states that our world is already a blend of virtual and real, although the existing metaverse feels somewhat dull, limited to basic text and images. KO believes future social needs in the virtual realm will mirror the physical world, encompassing virtual buildings, properties, and currencies.

He also shares advice on identifying valuable NFTs, highlighting the importance of real-world connections and recognizable artists.

In 2013, global crowdfunding platforms raised over $5 billion to support new startups. To assist in fundraising efforts, Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) is considering the feasibility of open private crowdfunding platforms, potentially expanding from the Emerging Stock Market to other sectors. The Ministry of Economic Affairs plans to amend the Company Act, establishing specific chapters for "closed companies" and creating legal foundations for internet companies.

During a special meeting led by Premier Jiang Yi-huah focusing on the regulation of virtual world development, he emphasized the need for regulatory adaptations to align with international trends rather than traditional manufacturing mindsets. Various government agencies are urged to adopt open and innovative thinking, promoting self-regulation and minimal management to enhance regulatory reviews, declaring this year as the inaugural year for regulatory adjustments for virtual world development.

Minister without Portfolio Tsai Yu-ling highlighted that many countries have already opened crowdfunding platforms. For instance, crowdfunding in 2012 reached $2.7 billion globally, increasing to $5.1 billion in 2013. Future considerations include the potential for donation and lending models outside current fundraising channels.

An example mentioned was Taiwanese youth Ju-Chun KO, who hopes to raise funds online to attend Singularity University in the U.S., founded by NASA. Should crowdfunding platforms open up, individuals could propose projects and raise funds based on public support, but questions remain about the nature of these funding methods‚Äîwhether they fall under donations or loans.

To enhance flexibility in equity arrangements before stock issuance for startups, Tsai indicated plans to relax Company Act regulations for closed companies, allowing shareholders more negotiable terms akin to practices observed in foreign companies. Many international firms have criticized Taiwan's Company Act for its limited flexibility regarding shareholder agreements.

Given that internet entrepreneurs significantly engage in the virtual realm, the Executive Yuan will conduct three online consultation meetings, the first in December, focusing on internet companies, intellectual property, online finance, and taxation. They also plan to reference international online dispute resolution mechanisms to construct resolution models and advocate for self-regulatory mechanisms to protect consumer rights in online transactions.
